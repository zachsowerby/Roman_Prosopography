1 1 The plebeians and Senate of Rome were often at strife with each other concerning the enactment of laws, the cancelling of debts, the division of lands, or the election of magistrates. Internal discord did not, however, bring them to blows; there were dissensions merely and contests within the limits of the law, which they composed by making mutual concessions, and with much respect for each other. Once when the plebeians were entering on a campaign they fell into a controversy of the sort, but they did not use the weapons in their hands, but withdrew to the hill, which from that time on was called the Sacred Mount. Even then no violence was done, but they created a magistrate for their protection and called him the Tribune of the Plebs, to serve especially as a check upon the consuls, who were chosen by the Senate,1 so that political power should not be exclusively in their hands. From this arose still greater bitterness, and the magistrates were arrayed in stronger animosity to each other from this time on, and the Senate and plebeians took sides with them, each believing that it would prevail over the other by augmenting the power of its own magistrates. It was in the midst of contests of this kind that <persName n="331">Marcius Coriolanus</persName>, having been banished contrary to justice, took refuge with the Volsci and levied war against his country.

2 1 This is the only case of armed strife that can be found in the ancient seditions, and this was caused by an exile. The sword was never carried into the assembly, and there was no civil butchery until <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName>, while serving as a tribune and bringing forward new laws, was the first to fall a victim to internal commotion; and with him many others, who were crowded together at the Capitol round the temple, were also slain. Sedition did not end with this abominable deed. Repeatedly the parties came into open conflict, often carrying daggers; and from time to time in the temples, or the assemblies, or the forum, some tribune, or praetor, or consul, or candidate for these offices, or some person otherwise distinguished, would be slain. Unseemly violence prevailed almost constantly, together with shameful contempt for law and justice. As the evil gained in magnitude open insurrections against the government and large warlike expeditions against their country were undertaken by exiles, or criminals, or persons contending against each other for some office or military command. There arose chiefs of factions quite frequently, aspiring to supreme power, some of them refusing to disband the troops entrusted to them by the people, others even hiring forces against each other on their own account, without public authority. Whenever either side first got possession of the city, the opposition party made war nominally against their own adversaries, but actually against their country. They assailed it like an enemy's capital, and ruthless and indiscriminate massacres of citizens were perpetrated. Some were proscribed, others banished, property was confiscated, and prisoners were even subjected to excruciating tortures.

3 1 No unseemly deed was left undone until, about fifty years after the death of <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName>, <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, one of these chiefs of factions, doctoring one evil with another, made himself sole master of the state for a very long time. Such officials were formerly called dictators — an office created in the most perilous emergencies for six months only, and long since fallen into disuse. But <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, although nominally elected, became dictator for life by force and compulsion. Nevertheless he became satiated with power and was the first man, so far as I know, holding supreme power, who had the courage to lay it down voluntarily and to declare that he would render an account of his stewardship to any who were dissatisfied with it. And so, for a considerable period, he walked to the forum as a private citizen in the sight of all and returned home unmolested, so great was the awe of his government still remaining in the minds of the onlookers, or their amazement at his laying it down. Perhaps they were ashamed to call him to account, or entertained other good feeling toward him, or a belief that his despotism had been beneficial to the state.

Thus there was a cessation of factions for a short time while <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> lived, and a compensation for the evils which he had wrought, 4 1 but after his death similar troubles broke out and continued until <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, who had held the command in Gaul by election for some years, when ordered by the Senate to lay down his command, excused himself on the ground that this was not the wish of the Senate, but of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, his enemy, who had command of an army in Italy, and was scheming to depose him. So he sent proposals that either both should retain their armies, so neither need fear the other's enmity, or that <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> also should dismiss his forces and live as a private citizen under the laws in like manner with himself. Both suggestions being refused, he marched from Gaul against <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> into Roman territory, entered Rome, and finding <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> fled, pursued him into Thessaly, won a brilliant victory over him in a great battle, and followed him to Egypt. After <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> had been slain by certain Egyptians <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> set to work on Egyptian affairs and remained there until he could settle the dynasty of that country. Then he returned to Rome. Having overpowered by war his principal rival, who had been surnamed the Great on account of his brilliant military exploits, he now ruled without disguise, nobody daring any longer to dispute with him about anything, and was chosen, next after <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, dictator for life. Again all civil dissensions ceased until <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, envious of his great power and desiring to restore the government of their fathers, slew in the Senate-house one who had proved himself truly popular, and most experienced in the art of government. The people certainly mourned for him greatly. They scoured the city in pursuit of his murderers, buried him in the middle of the forum, built a temple on the site of his funeral pyre, and offer sacrifice to him as a god.

5 1 And now civil discord broke out again worse than ever and increased enormously. Massacres, banishments, and proscriptions of both senators and knights took place straightway, including great numbers of both classes, the chiefs of factions surrendering their enemies to each other, and for this purpose not sparing even their friends and brothers; so much did animosity toward rivals overpower the love of kindred. So in the course of events the Roman empire was partitioned, as though it had been their private property, by these three men: <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, and the one who was first called <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, but afterwards xxxxx from his relationship to the other <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and adoption in his will. Shortly after this division they fell to quarrelling among themselves, as was natural, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, who was the superior in understanding and skill, first deprived <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> of Africa, which had fallen to his lot, and afterward, as the result of the battle of Actium, took from <persName n="27">Antony</persName> all the provinces lying between Syria and the Adriatic gulf. Thereupon, while all the world was filled with astonishment at these wonderful displays of power, he sailed to Egypt and took that country, which was the oldest and at that time the strongest possession of the successors of <persName n="10">Alexander</persName>, and the only one wanting to complete the Roman empire as it now stands. In immediate consequence of these exploits he was, while still living, the first to be regarded by the Romans as 'august,'3 and to be called by them "<persName n="61">Augustus</persName>." He assumed to himself an authority like <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s over the country and the subject nations, and even greater than <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s, no longer needing any form of election, or authorization, or even the pretence of it. His government proved both lasting and masterful, and being himself successful in all things and dreaded by all, he left a lineage and succession that held the supreme power in like manner after him.

6 1 Thus, out of multifarious civil commotions, the Roman state passed into harmony and monarchy. To show how these things came about I have written and compiled this narrative, which is well worth the study of those who wish to know the measureless ambition of men, their dreadful lust of power, their unwearying perseverance, and the countless forms of evil. And it is especially necessary for me to describe these things beforehand since they are the preliminaries of my Egyptian history, and will end where that begins, for Egypt was seized in consequence of this last civil commotion, <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName> having joined forces with <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. On account of its magnitude I have divided the work, first taking up the events that occurred from the time of <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> to that of <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>; next, those that followed to the death of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. The remaining books of the civil wars treat of those waged by the triumvirs against each other and the Roman people, up to the grand climax of these conflicts, the battle of Actium fought by <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> against <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName> together, which will be the beginning of the Egyptian history.



I
7 1 The Romans, as they subdued the Italian peoples successively in war, used to seize a part of their lands and build towns there, or enroll colonists of their own to occupy those already existing, and their idea was to use these as outposts;4 but of the land acquired by war they assigned the cultivated part forthwith to the colonists, or sold or leased it. Since they had no leisure as yet to allot the part which then lay desolated by war (this was generally the greater part), they made proclamation that in the meantime those who were willing to work it might do so for a toll of the yearly crops, a tenth of the grain and a fifth of the fruit. From those who kept flocks was required a toll of the animals, both oxen and small cattle. They did these things in order to multiply the Italian race, which they considered the most laborious of peoples, so that they might have plenty of allies at home. But the very opposite thing happened; for the rich, getting possession of the greater part of the undistributed lands, and being emboldened by the lapse of time to believe that they would never be dispossessed, absorbing any adjacent strips and their poor neighbours' allotments, partly by purchase under persuasion and partly by force, came to cultivate vast tracts instead of single estates, using slaves as labourers and herdsmen, lest free labourers should be drawn from agriculture into the army. At the same time the ownership of slaves brought them great gain from the multitude of their progeny, who increased because they were exempt from military service. Thus certain powerful men became extremely rich and the race of slaves multiplied throughout the country, while the Italian people dwindled in numbers and strength, being oppressed by penury, taxes, and military service. If they had any respite from these evils they passed their time in idleness, because the land was held by the rich, who employed slaves instead of freemen as cultivators.

8 1 For these reasons the people became troubled lest they should no longer have sufficient allies of the Italian stock, and lest the government itself should be endangered by such a vast number of slaves. As they did not perceive any remedy, for it was not easy, nor in any way just, to deprive men of so many possessions they had held so long, including their own trees, buildings, and fixtures, a law was at last passed with difficulty at the instance of the tribunes, that nobody should hold more than 500 jugera5 of this land,6 or pasture on it more than 100 cattle or 500 sheep. To ensure the observance of this law it was provided also that there should be a certain number of freemen employed on the farms, whose business it should be to watch and report what was going on.

Having thus comprehended all this in a law, they took an oath over and above the law, and fixed penalties for violating it, and it was supposed that the remaining land would soon be divided among the poor in small parcels. But there was not the smallest consideration shown for the law or the oaths. The few who seemed to pay some respect to them conveyed their lands to their relations fraudulently, but the greater part disregarded it altogether, 9 1 till at last <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName>, an illustrious man, eager for glory, a most powerful speaker, and for these reasons well known to all, delivered an eloquent discourse, while serving as tribune, concerning the Italian race, lamenting that a people so valiant in war, and related in blood to the Romans, were declining little by little into pauperism and paucity of numbers without any hope of remedy. He inveighed against the multitude of slaves as useless in war and never faithful to their masters, and adduced the recent calamity brought upon the masters by their slaves in Sicily,7 where the demands of agriculture had greatly increased the number of the latter; recalling also the war waged against them by the Romans, which was neither easy nor short, but long-protracted and full of vicissitudes and dangers. After speaking thus he again brought forward the law, providing that nobody should hold more than the 500 jugera of the public domain. But he added a provision to the former law, that the sons of the occupiers might each hold one-half of that amount, and that the remainder should be divided among the poor by three elected commissioners,8 who should be changed annually.

10 1 This was extremely disturbing to the rich because, on account of the triumvirs, they could no longer disregard the law as they had done before; nor could they buy the allotments of others, because <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> had provided against this by forbidding sales. They collected together in groups, and made lamentation, and accused the poor of appropriating the results of their tillage, their vineyards, and their dwellings. Some said that they had paid the price of the land to their neighbours. Were they to lose the money with their land? Others said that the graves of their ancestors were in the ground, which had been allotted to them in the division of their fathers' estates. Others said that their wives' dowries had been expended on the estates, or that the land had been given to their own daughters as dowry. Money-lenders could show loans made on this security. All kinds of wailing and expressions of indignation were heard at once. On the other side were heard the lamentations of the poor — that they were being reduced from competence to extreme penury, and from that to childlessness, because they were unable to rear their offspring. They recounted the military services they had rendered, by which this very land had been acquired, and were angry that they should be robbed of their share of the common property. They reproached the rich for employing slaves, who were always faithless and ill-disposed and for that reason unserviceable in war, instead of freemen, citizens, and soldiers. While these classes were thus lamenting and indulging in mutual accusations, a great number of others, composed of colonists, or inhabitants of the free towns, or persons otherwise interested in the lands and who were under like apprehensions, flocked in and took sides with their respective factions. Emboldened by numbers and exasperated against each other they kindled considerable disturbances, and waited eagerly for the voting on the new law, some intending to prevent its enactment by all means, and others to enact it at all costs. In addition to personal interest the spirit of rivalry spurred both sides in the preparations they were making against each other for the appointed day.

11 1 What <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> had in his mind in proposing the measure was not money, but men. Inspired greatly by the usefulness of the work, and believing that nothing more advantageous or admirable could ever happen to Italy, he took no account of the difficulties surrounding it. When the time for voting came he advanced many other arguments at considerable length and also asked them whether it was not just to let the commons divide the common property; whether a citizen was not worthy of more consideration at all times than a slave; whether a man who served in the army was not more useful than one who did not; and whether one who had a share in the country was not more likely to be devoted to the public interests. He did not dwell long on this comparison between freemen and slaves, which he considered degrading, but proceeded at once to a review of their hopes and fears for the country, saying that the Romans possessed most of their territory by conquest, and that they had hopes of occupying the rest of the habitable world; but now the question of greatest hazard was, whether they should gain the rest by having plenty of brave men, or whether, through their weakness and mutual jealousy, their enemies should take away what they already possessed. After exaggerating the glory and riches on the one side and the danger and fear on the other, he admonished the rich to take heed, and said that for the realization of these hopes they ought to bestow this very land as a free gift, if necessary, on men who would rear children, and not, by contending about small things, overlook larger ones; especially since for any labour they had spent they were receiving ample compensation in the undisputed title to 500 jugera each of free land, in a high state of cultivation, without cost, and half as much more for each son in the case of those who had sons. After saying much more to the same purport and exciting the poor, as well as others who were moved by reason rather than by the desire for gain, he ordered the clerk to read the proposed law.

12 1 <persName n="343">Marcus Octavius</persName>, however, another tribune, who had been induced by those in possession of the lands to interpose his veto (for among the Romans the negative veto always defeats an affirmative proposal), ordered the clerk to keep silence. Thereupon <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> reproached him severely and adjourned the comitia to the following day.9 Then he stationed near himself a sufficient guard, as if to force <persName n="343">Marcus Octavius</persName> against his will, and ordered the clerk with threats to read the proposed law to the multitude. He began to read, but when <persName n="343">Marcus Octavius</persName> again forbade he stopped. Then the tribunes fell to wrangling with each other, and a considerable tumult arose among the people. The leading citizens besought the tribunes to submit their controversy to the Senate for decision. <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> seized on the suggestion, believing that the law was acceptable to all well-disposed persons, and hastened to the senate-house. But, as he had only a few followers there and was upbraided by the rich, he ran back to the forum and said that he would take the vote at the comitia of the following day, both on the law and on the official rights of <persName n="343">Marcus Octavius</persName>, to determine whether a tribune who was acting contrary to the people's interest could continue to hold office. And this <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> did; for when <persName n="343">Marcus Octavius</persName>, nothing daunted, again interposed, <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> proposed to take the vote on him first.

When the first tribe voted to abrogate the magistracy of <persName n="343">Marcus Octavius</persName>, <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> turned to him and begged him to desist from his veto. As he would not yield, he took the votes of the other tribes. There were thirty-five tribes at that time. The seventeen that voted first passionately supported the motion. If the eighteenth should do the same it would make a majority. Again did <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName>, in the sight of the people, urgently importune <persName n="343">Marcus Octavius</persName> in his present extreme danger not to prevent a work which was most righteous and useful to all Italy, and not to frustrate the wishes so earnestly entertained by the people, whose desires he ought rather to share in his character of tribune, and not to risk the loss of his office by public condemnation. After speaking thus he called the gods to witness that he did not willingly do any despite to his colleague. As <persName n="343">Marcus Octavius</persName> was still unyielding he went on taking the vote. <persName n="343">Marcus Octavius</persName> was forthwith reduced to the rank of a private citizen and slunk away unobserved. <persName n="476">Quintus Mummius</persName> was chosen tribune in his place, and the agrarian law was enacted.

13 1 The first triumvirs appointed to divide the land were <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> himself, the proposer of the law, his brother of the same name, and his father-in‑law, <persName n="33">Appius Claudius</persName>, since the people still feared that the law might fail of execution unless <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> should take the lead with his whole family. <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> became immensely popular by reason of the law and was escorted home by the multitude as though he were the founder, not of a single city or race, but of all the nations of Italy. After this the victorious party returned to the fields from which they had come to attend to this business. The defeated ones remained in the city and talked the matter over, feeling aggrieved, and saying that as soon as <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> should become a private citizen he would be sorry that he had done despite to the sacred and inviolable office of tribune, and had sown in Italy so many seeds of future strife.


II
14 1 It was now summer, and the election of tribunes was imminent. As the day for voting approached it was very evident that the rich had earnestly promoted the election of those most inimical to <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName>. The latter, fearing that evil would befall if he should not be re-elected for the following year, summoned his friends from the fields to attend the election, but as they were occupied with harvest he was obliged, when the day fixed for the voting drew near, to have recourse to the plebeians of the city. So he went around asking each one separately to elect him tribune for the ensuing year, on account of the danger he was incurring for them. When the voting took place the first two tribes pronounced for <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName>. The rich objected that it was not lawful for the same man to hold the office twice in succession. The tribune <persName n="491">Rubrius</persName>, who had been chosen by lot to preside over the comitia, was in doubt about it, and <persName n="476">Quintus Mummius</persName>, who had been chosen in place of <persName n="343">Marcus Octavius</persName>, urged him to hand over the comitia to his charge. This he did, but the remaining tribunes contended that the presidency should be decided by lot, saying that when <persName n="491">Rubrius</persName>, who had been chosen in that way, resigned, the casting of lots ought to be done over again by all. As there was much strife over this question, <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName>, who was getting the worst of it, adjourned the voting to the following day. In utter despair he went about in black, though still in office, and led his son around the forum and introduced him to each man and committed him to their charge, as if he himself felt that death, at the hands of his enemies, were at hand.

15 1 The poor when they had time to think were moved with deep sorrow, both on their own account (for they believed that they were no longer to live in a free estate under equal laws, but would be reduced to servitude by the rich), and on account of <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> himself, who was in such fear and torment in their behalf. So they all accompanied him with tears to his house in the evening, and bade him be of good courage for the morrow. <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> cheered up, assembled his partisans before daybreak, and communicated to them a signal to be displayed if there were need for fighting. He then took possession of the temple on the Capitoline hill, where the voting was to take place, and occupied the middle of the assembly. As he was obstructed by the other tribunes and by the rich, who would not allow the votes to be taken on this question, he gave the signal. There was a sudden shout from those who knew of it, and violence followed. Some of the partisans of <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> took position around him like body-guards. Others, having girded up their clothes, seized the fasces and staves in the hands of the lictors and broke them in pieces. They drove the rich out of the assembly with such disorder and wounds that the tribunes fled from their places in terror, and the priests closed the doors of the temple. Many ran away pell-mell and scattered wild rumours. Some said that <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> had deposed all the other tribunes, and this was believed because none of them could be seen. Others said that he had declared himself tribune for the ensuing year without an election.

16 1 In these circumstances the Senate assembled at the temple of Fides. It is astonishing to me that they never thought of appointing a dictator in this emergency, although they had often been protected by the government of a single ruler in such times of peril; but a resource which had been found most useful in former times was never even recollected by the people, either then or later. After reaching such decision as they did reach, they marched up to the Capitol, <persName n="511">Scipio Nasica</persName>, the pontifex maximus, leading the way and calling out with a loud voice, "Let those who would save our country follow me." He wound the border of his toga about his head either to induce a greater number to go with him by the singularity of his appearance, or to make for himself, as it were, a helmet as a sign of battle for those who saw it, or in order to conceal himself from the gods on account of what he was about to do. When he arrived at the temple and advanced against the partisans of <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> they yielded out of regard for so excellent a citizen, and because they observed the Senators following with him. The latter wresting their clubs out of the hands of the Gracchans themselves, or breaking up benches and other furniture that had been brought for the use of the assembly, began beating them, and pursued them, and drove them over the precipice.11 In the tumult many of the Gracchans perished, and <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> himself, vainly circling round the temple,12 was slain at the door close by the statues of the kings. All the bodies were thrown by night into the Tiber.

17 1 So perished on the Capitol, and while still tribune, <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName>, the son of that <persName n="222">Gracchus</persName> who was twice consul, and of <persName n="123">Cornelia</persName>, daughter of that <persName n="509">Scipio Aemilianus</persName> who robbed Carthage of her supremacy. He lost his life in consequence of a most excellent design too violently pursued; and this abominable crime, the first that was perpetrated in the public assembly, was seldom without parallels thereafter from time to time. On the subject of the murder of <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> the city was divided between sorrow and joy. Some mourned for themselves and for him, and deplored the present condition of things, believing that the commonwealth no longer existed, but had been supplanted by force and violence. Others considered that their dearest wishes were accomplished.


III
18 1 These things took place at the time with <persName n="47">Aristonicus</persName> was contending with the Romans for the government of Asia; but after <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> was slain and <persName n="33">Appius Claudius</persName> died, <persName n="174">Fulvius Flaccus</persName> and <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> were appointed, in conjunction with the younger <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName>, to divide the land. As the persons in possession neglected to hand in lists of their holdings, a proclamation was issued that informers should furnish testimony against them. Immediately a great number of embarrassing lawsuits sprang up. Wherever a new field adjoining an old one had been bought, or divided among the allies, the whole district had to be carefully inquired into on account of the measurement of this one field, to discover how it had been sold and how divided. Not all owners had preserved their contracts, or their allotment titles, and even those that were found were often ambiguous. When the land was resurveyed some owners were obliged to give up their fruit-trees and farm-buildings in exchange for naked ground. Others were transferred from cultivated to uncultivated lands, or to swamps, or pools. In fact, the land having originally been so much loot, the survey had never been carefully done. As the original proclamation authorized anybody to work the undistributed land who wished to do so, many had been prompted to cultivate the parts immediately adjoining their own, till the line of demarcation between public and private had faded from view. The progress of time also made many changes. Thus the injustice done by the rich, although great, was not easy to ascertain. So there was nothing but a general turn-about, all parties being moved out of their own places and settling down in other people's.

19 1 The Italian allies who complained of these disturbances, and especially of the lawsuits hastily brought against them, chose <persName n="509">Scipio Aemilianus</persName>, the destroyer of Carthage, to defend them against these grievances. As he had availed himself of their very zealous support in war he was reluctant to disregard their request. So he came into the Senate, and although, out of regard for the plebeians, he did not openly find fault with the law of <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName>, he expatiated on its difficulties and urged that these causes should not be decided by the triumvirs, because they did not possess the confidence of the litigants, but should be assigned to other courts. As his view seemed reasonable, they yielded to his persuasion, and the consul <persName n="580">Tuditanus</persName> was appointed to give judgment in these cases. But when he took up the work he saw the difficulties of it, and marched against the Illyrians as a pretext for not acting as judge, and since nobody brought cases for trial before the triumvirs they remained idle. From this cause hatred and indignation arose among the people against <persName n="509">Scipio Aemilianus</persName> because they saw a man, in whose favour they had often opposed the aristocracy and incurred their enmity, electing him consul twice contrary to law, now taking the side of the Italian allies against themselves. When <persName n="509">Scipio Aemilianus</persName>'s enemies observed this, they cried out that he was determined to abolish the law of <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> utterly and for that end was about to inaugurate armed strife and bloodshed.

20 1 When the people heard these charges they were in a state of alarm until <persName n="509">Scipio Aemilianus</persName>, after placing near his couch at home one evening a tablet on which to write during the night the speech he intended to deliver before the people, was found dead in his bed without a wound. Whether this was done by <persName n="123">Cornelia Gracchi</persName>, the mother of the Gracchi (aided by her daughter, Sempronia, who though married to <persName n="509">Scipio Aemilianus</persName> was both unloved and unloving because she was deformed and childless), lest the law of <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> should be abolished, or whether, as some think, he committed suicide because he saw plainly that he could not accomplish what he had promised, is not known. Some say that slaves under torture testified that unknown persons were introduced through the rear of the house by night who suffocated him, and that those who knew about it hesitated to tell because the people were angry with him still and rejoiced at his death.

So died <persName n="509">Scipio Aemilianus</persName>, and although he had been of extreme service to the Roman power he was not even honoured with a public funeral; so much does the anger of the present moment outweigh the gratitude for the past. And this event, sufficiently important in itself, took place as a mere incident of the sedition of <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName>.

21 1 Even after these events those who were in possession of the lands postponed the division on various pretexts for a very long time. Some proposed that all the Italian allies, who made the greatest resistance to it, should be admitted to Roman citizenship so that, out of gratitude for the greater favour, they might no longer quarrel about the land. The Italians were ready to accept this, because they preferred Roman citizenship to possession of the fields. <persName n="174">Fulvius Flaccus</persName>, who was then both consul and triumvir, exerted himself to the utmost to bring it about, but the senators were angry at the thought of making their subjects equal citizens with themselves.

For this reason the attempt was abandoned, and the populace, who had been so long in the hope of acquiring land, became disheartened. While they were in this mood <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName>, who had made himself agreeable to them as a triumvir, offered himself for the tribuneship. He was the younger brother of <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName>, the promoter of the law, and had been quiet for some time after his brother's death, but since many of the senators treated him scornfully he announced himself as a candidate for the office of tribune. Being elected with flying colours he began to lay plots against the Senate, and made the unprecedented suggestion that a monthly distribution of corn should be made to each citizen at the public expense. Thus he quickly got the leadership of the people by one political measure, in which he had the cooperation of <persName n="174">Fulvius Flaccus</persName>. Directly after that he was chosen tribune for the following year, for in cases where there was not a sufficient number of candidates the law authorized the people to choose further tribunes from the whole body of citizens.

22 1 Thus <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> was tribune a second time. Having bought the plebeians, as it were, he began, by another like political manoeuvre, to court the equestrian order, who hold the middle place between the Senate and the plebeians. He transferred the courts of justice, which had become discredited by reason of bribery, from the senators to the knights, reproaching the former especially with the recent examples of <persName n="68">Aurelius Cotta</persName>, <persName n="499">Salinator</persName>, and, third in the list, <persName n="315">Manius Aquilius</persName> (the subduer of Asia), all notorious bribe-takers, who had been acquitted by the judges, although ambassadors sent to complain of their conduct were still present, going around uttering bitter accusations against them. The Senate was extremely ashamed of these things and yielded to the law, and the people ratified it. In this way were the courts of justice transferred from the Senate to the knights. It is said that soon after the passage of this law <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> remarked that he had broken the power of the Senate once for all, and the saying of <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> received a deeper and deeper significance by the course of events. For this power of sitting in judgment on all Romans and Italians, including the senators themselves, in all matters as to property, civil rights, and banishment, exalted the knights to be rulers over them, and put senators on the level of subjects. Moreover, as the knights voted in the election to sustain the power of the tribunes, and obtained from them whatever they wanted in return, they became more and more formidable to the senators. So it shortly came about that the political mastery was turned upside down, the power being in the hands of the knights, and the honour only remaining with the Senate. The knights indeed went so far that they not only held power over the senators, but they openly flouted them beyond their right. They also became addicted to bribe-taking, and when they too had tasted these enormous gains, they indulged in them even more basely and immoderately than the senators had done. They suborned accusers against the rich and did away with prosecutions for bribe-taking altogether, partly by agreement among themselves and partly by open violence, so that the practice of this kind of investigation became entirely obsolete. Thus the judiciary law gave rise to another struggle of factions, which lasted a long time and was not less baneful than the former ones.

23 1 <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> also made long roads throughout Italy and thus put a multitude of contractors and artisans under obligations to him and made them ready to do whatever he wished. He proposed the founding of numerous colonies. He also called on the Latin allies to demand the full rights of Roman citizenship, since the Senate could not with decency refuse this privilege to men who were of the same race. To the other allies, who were not allowed to vote in Roman elections, he sought to give the right of suffrage, in order to have their help in the enactment of laws which he had in contemplation. The Senate was very much alarmed at this, and it ordered the consuls to give the following public notice, "Nobody who does not possess the right of suffrage shall stay in the city or approach within forty stades13 of it while voting is going on concerning these laws." The Senate also persuaded <persName n="269">Livius Drusus</persName>, another tribune, to interpose his veto against the laws proposed by <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName>, but not to tell the people his reasons for doing so; for a tribune was not required to give reasons for his veto. In order to conciliate the people they gave <persName n="269">Livius Drusus</persName> the privilege of founding twelve colonies, and the plebeians were so much pleased with this that they scoffed at the laws proposed by <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName>.

24 1 Having lost the favour of the rabble, <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> sailed for Africa in company with <persName n="174">Fulvius Flaccus</persName>, who, after his consulship, had been chosen tribune for the same reasons as <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> himself. It had been decided to send a colony to Africa on account of its reputed fertility, and these men had been expressly chosen the founders of it in order to get them out of the way for a while, so that the Senate might have a respite from demagogism. They marked out the city for the colony on the place where Carthage had formerly stood, disregarding the fact that <persName n="509">Scipio Aemilianus</persName>, when he destroyed it, had devoted it with solemn imprecations to sheep-pasturage for ever. They assigned 6000 colonists to this place, instead of the smaller number fixed by law, in order further to curry favour with the people thereby. When they returned to Rome they invited the 6000 from the whole of Italy. The functionaries who were still in Africa laying out the city wrote home that wolves had pulled up and scattered the boundary marks made by <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> and <persName n="174">Fulvius Flaccus</persName>, and the soothsayers considered this an ill omen for the colony. So the Senate summoned the comitia, in which it was proposed to repeal the law concerning this colony. When <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> and <persName n="174">Fulvius Flaccus</persName> saw their failure in this matter they were furious, and declared that the Senate had lied about the wolves. The boldest of the plebeians joined them, carrying daggers, and proceeded to the Capitol, where the assembly was to be held in reference to the colony.

25 1 Now the people had come together already, and <persName n="174">Fulvius Flaccus</persName> had begun speaking about the business in hand, when <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> arrived at the Capitol attended by a body-guard of his partisans. Conscience-stricken by what he knew about the extraordinary plans on foot he turned aside from the meeting-place of the assembly, passed into the portico, and walked about waiting to see what would happen. Just then a plebeian named <persName n="28">Antyllus</persName>, who was sacrificing in the portico, saw him in this disturbed state, laid his hand upon him, either because he had heard or suspected something, or was moved to speak to him for some other reason, and begged him to spare his country. <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName>, still more disturbed, and startled like one detected in a crime, gave the man a sharp look. Then one of his party, although no signal had been displayed or order given, inferred merely from the angry glance that <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> cast upon <persName n="28">Antyllus</persName> that the time for action had come, and thought that he should do a favour to <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> by striking the first blow. So he drew his dagger and slew <persName n="28">Antyllus</persName>. A cry was raised, the dead body was seen in the midst of the crowd, and all who were outside fled from the temple in fear of a like fate.

<persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> went into the assembly desiring to exculpate himself of the deed, but nobody would so much as listen to him. All turned away from him as from one stained with blood. So both he and <persName n="174">Fulvius Flaccus</persName> were at their wits' end and, having lost through this hasty act the chance of accomplishing what they wished, they hastened to their homes, and their partisans with them. The rest of the crowd occupied the forum after midnight as though some calamity were impending, and <persName n="301">Lucius Opimius</persName> the consul who was staying in the city, ordered an armed force to gather in the Capitol at daybreak, and sent heralds to convoke the Senate. He took his own station in the temple of Castor and Pollux in the centre of the city and there awaited events.

26 1 When these arrangements had been made the Senate summoned <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> and <persName n="174">Fulvius Flaccus</persName> from their homes to the senate-house to defend themselves. But they ran out armed toward the Aventine hill, hoping that if they could seize it first the Senate would agree to some terms with them. As they ran through the city they offered freedom to the slaves, but none listened to them. With such forces as they had, however, they occupied and fortified the temple of Diana, and sent <persName n="470">Quintus Flaccus</persName>, the son of <persName n="174">Fulvius Flaccus</persName>, to the Senate seeking to come to an arrangement and to live in harmony. The Senate replied that they should lay down their arms, come to the senate-house, and tell them what they wanted, or else send no more messengers. When they sent <persName n="470">Quintus Flaccus</persName> a second time the consul <persName n="301">Lucius Opimius</persName> arrested him, as being no longer an ambassador after he had been warned, and at the same time sent his armed men against the Gracchans.

<persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> fled across the river by the wooden bridge with one slave to a grove, and there, being on the point of arrest, he presented his throat to the slave. <persName n="174">Fulvius Flaccus</persName> took refuge in the workshop of an acquaintance. As his pursuers did not know which house he was in they threatened to burn the whole row. The man who had given shelter to the suppliant hesitated to point him out, but directed another man to do so. <persName n="174">Fulvius Flaccus</persName> was seized and put to death. The heads of <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> and <persName n="174">Fulvius Flaccus</persName> were carried to <persName n="301">Lucius Opimius</persName>, and he gave their weight in gold to those who brought them, but the people plundered their houses. <persName n="301">Lucius Opimius</persName> then arrested their fellow-conspirators, cast them into prison, and ordered that they should be strangled; but he allowed <persName n="470">Quintus Flaccus</persName>, the son of <persName n="174">Fulvius Flaccus</persName>, to choose his own mode of death. After this a lustration of the city was performed for the bloodshed, and the Senate ordered the building of a temple to Concord in the forum.



IV
27 1 Thus the sedition of the younger <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> came to an end. Not long afterward a law was enacted to permit the holders to sell the land about which they had quarrelled; for even this had been forbidden by the law of the elder Gracchus. At once the rich began to buy the allotments of the poor, or found pretexts15 for seizing them by force. So the condition of the poor became even worse than it was before, until <persName n="543">Spurius Thorius</persName>, a tribune of the people, brought in a law providing that the work of distributing the public domain should no longer be continued, but that the land should belong to those in possession of it, who should pay rent for it to the people, and that the money so received should be distributed; and this distribution was a kind of solace to the poor, but it did not help to increase the population. By these devices the law of <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName> — a most excellent and useful one, if it could have been carried out — was once for all frustrated, and a little later the rent itself was abolished at the instance of another tribune. So the plebeians lost everything, and hence resulted a still further decline in the numbers both of citizens and soldiers, and in the revenue from the land and the distribution thereof and in the allotments themselves; and about fifteen years after the enactment of the law of <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName>, by reason of a series of lawsuits, the people were reduced to unemployment.16

28 1 About this time the consul <persName n="511">Scipio Nasica</persName> demolished the theatre begun by <persName n="289">Lucius Cassius</persName>, and now nearly finished, because he considered this also a likely source of new seditions, or because he thought it far from desirable that the Romans should become accustomed to Grecian pleasures. The censor, <persName n="361">Metellus Numidicus</persName>, attempted to degrade <persName n="212">Glaucia</persName>, a senator, and <persName n="503">Saturninus</persName>, who had already been a tribune, on account of their disgraceful mode of life, but was not able to do so because his colleague would not agree to it. Accordingly <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName>, a little later, in order to have revenge on <persName n="361">Metellus Numidicus</persName>, became again a candidate for the tribuneship, seizing the occasion when <persName n="212">Glaucia</persName>  held the office of praetor, and presided over the election of the tribunes; but <persName n="384">Nonius</persName>, a man of noble birth, who used much plainness of speech in reference to <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName> and reproached <persName n="212">Glaucia</persName>  bitterly, was chosen for the office. They, fearing lest he should punish them as tribune, made a rush upon him with a crowd of ruffians just as he was going away from the comitia, pursued him into an inn, and stabbed him. As this murder bore a pitiful and shocking aspect, the adherents of <persName n="212">Glaucia</persName>  came together early the next morning, before the people had assembled, and elected <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName> tribune.

In this way the killing of <persName n="384">Nonius</persName> was hushed up, since everybody was afraid to call <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName> to account because he was a tribune; 29 1 and <persName n="361">Metellus Numidicus</persName> also was banished by his enemies with the help of <persName n="602">Marius</persName>, who was then in his sixth consulship, and was his secret enemy. Thus they all worked with each other. Then <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName> brought forward a law to divide the land which the Cimbri (a Celtic tribe lately driven out by <persName n="602">Marius</persName>) had seized in the country now called Gaul by the Romans, and which was considered as now no longer Gallic but Roman territory. It was provided also in this law that, if the people should enact it, the senators should take an oath within five days to obey it, and that any one who should refuse to do so should be expelled from the Senate and should pay a fine of twenty talents for the benefit of the people. Thus they intended to punish those who should take it with bad grace, and especially <persName n="361">Metellus Numidicus</persName>, who was too high-spirited to submit to the oath. Such was the proposed law. <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName> appointed the day for holding the comitia and sent messengers to inform those in country districts, in whom he had the utmost confidence, because they had served in the army under <persName n="602">Marius</persName>. As the law gave the larger share to the Italian allies the city people were not pleased with it.

30 1 A disturbance broke out in the comitia. Those who attempted to prevent the passage of the laws proposed by the tribunes were assaulted by <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName> and driven away from the rostra. The city crowd exclaimed that thunder was heard in the assembly, in which case it is not permitted by Roman custom to finish the business that day. As the adherents of <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName> nevertheless persisted, the city people girded themselves, seized whatever clubs they could lay their hands on, and dispersed the rustics. The latter were rallied by <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName>; they attacked the city folks with clubs, overcame them, and passed the law. As soon as this was done <persName n="602">Marius</persName>, as consul, proposed to the Senate that they should consider the question of the oath. Knowing that <persName n="361">Metellus Numidicus</persName> was a man of stiff opinions and resolute about anything he either felt or had committed himself to by word of mouth, he himself first gave his own opinion publicly, but hypocritically, saying that he would never willingly take this oath himself. When <persName n="361">Metellus Numidicus</persName> had agreed with him in this, and the others had approved them both, <persName n="602">Marius</persName> adjourned the Senate. On the fifth day thereafter (the last day prescribed in the law for taking the oath) he called them together in haste about the tenth hour, saying that he was afraid of the people because they were so zealous for the law. He saw a way, however, to avoid it, and he proposed the following trick — to swear that they would obey this law as far as it was a law, and thus at once disperse the country people by stratagem. Afterward it could be easily shown that this law, which had been enacted by violence and after thunder had been reported, contrary to the custom of their ancestors, was not really a law.

31 1 After speaking thus he did not wait for the result, but while all were in silent amazement at the plot, and confused because there was no time to be lost, giving them no opportunity for thinking, he rose and went to the temple of Saturn, where the quaestors were accustomed to administer oaths, and took the oath first with his friends. The rest followed his example, as each one feared for his own safety. <persName n="361">Metellus Numidicus</persName> alone refused to swear, but stood fearlessly by his first determination. <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName> at once on the next day sent his officer for him and tried to drag him out of the senate-house. But when the other tribunes defended him <persName n="212">Glaucia</persName>  and <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName> hastened to the country people and told them that they would never get the land, and that the law would not be executed, unless <persName n="361">Metellus Numidicus</persName> were banished. They then proposed a decree of banishment against him and directed the consuls to interdict him from fire, water, and shelter, and appointed a day for the ratification of this decree. Great was the indignation of the city people, who constantly escorted <persName n="361">Metellus Numidicus</persName>, carrying daggers. He thanked them and praised them for their good intentions, but said that he could not allow any danger to befall the country on his account. After saying this he withdrew from the city. <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName> got the decree ratified, and <persName n="602">Marius</persName> made proclamation of the contents of the decree.

32 1 In this way was <persName n="361">Metellus Numidicus</persName>, a most admirable man, sent into banishment. Thereupon <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName> was tribune a third time and had for a colleague one who was thought to be a fugitive slave, but who claimed to be a son of the elder <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName>, and the multitude supported him in the election because they regretted <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName>. When the election for consuls came on <persName n="322">Marcus Antonius</persName> was chosen as one of them by common consent, while the aforesaid <persName n="212">Glaucia</persName> and <persName n="354">Memmius</persName> contended for the other place. <persName n="354">Memmius</persName> was the more illustrious man by far, and <persName n="212">Glaucia</persName> and <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName> were anxious about the result. So they sent a gang of ruffians to attack him with clubs while the election was going on, who fell upon <persName n="354">Memmius</persName> in the midst of the comitia and beat him to death in the sight of all.

The assembly was broken up in terror. Neither laws nor courts nor sense of shame remained. The people ran together in anger the following day intending to kill <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName>, but he had collected another mob from the country and, with <persName n="212">Glaucia</persName> and <persName n="505">Saufeius</persName>, the quaestor, seized the Capitol. The Senate voted them public enemies. <persName n="602">Marius</persName> was vexed; nevertheless he armed some of his forces reluctantly, and, while he was delaying, some other persons cut off the water-supply from the Capitoline temple. <persName n="505">Saufeius</persName> was near perishing with thirst and proposed to set the temple on fire, but <persName n="212">Glaucia</persName> and <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName>, who hoped that <persName n="602">Marius</persName> would assist them, surrendered first, and after them <persName n="505">Saufeius</persName>. As everybody demanded that they should be put to death at once, <persName n="602">Marius</persName> shut them up in the senate-house as though he intended to deal with them in a more legal manner. The crowd considered this a mere pretext, tore the tiles off the roof, and stoned them to death, including a quaestor, a tribune, and a praetor, who were still wearing their insignia of office.

33 1 Very many others were swept out of existence in this sedition. Among them was that other tribune who was supposed to be the son of <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName>, and who perished on the first day of his magistracy. Freedom, democracy, laws, reputation, official position, were no longer of any use to anybody, since even the office of tribune, which had been devised for the restraint of wrong-doers and the protection of the plebeians, and was sacred and inviolable, now was guilty of such outrages and suffered such indignities. When the party of <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName> was destroyed the Senate and people clamoured for the recall of <persName n="361">Metellus Numidicus</persName>, but <persName n="448">Publius Furius</persName>, a tribune who was not the son of a free citizens but of a freedman, boldly resisted them. Not even <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName>, the son of <persName n="361">Metellus Numidicus</persName>, who besought him in the presence of the people with tears in his eyes, and threw himself at his feet, could move him. From this dramatic appearance the son ever afterward bore the name of <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName>. The following year <persName n="448">Publius Furius</persName> was called to account for his obstinacy by the new tribune, <persName n="183">Gaius Canuleius</persName>. The people did not wait for his excuses, but tore <persName n="448">Publius Furius</persName> in pieces. Thus every year some new abomination was committed in the forum. <persName n="361">Metellus Numidicus</persName>, however, was allowed to return, and it is said that a whole day was not sufficient for the greetings of those who went to meet him at the city gates.


V
Such was the third civil strife (that of <persName n="36">Apuleius</persName>) which succeeded those of <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> and <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName>, and such the results it brought to the Romans. 34 1 While they were thus occupied the so‑called Social War, in which many Italian peoples were engaged, broke out. It began unexpectedly, grew rapidly to great proportions and extinguished the Roman sedition for a long time by a new terror. When it was ended it also gave rise to new seditions under more powerful leaders, who did not work by introducing new laws, or by the tricks of the demagogue, but by matching whole armies against each other. I have treated it in this history because it had its origin in the sedition in Rome and resulted in another much worse. It began in this way.

<persName n="174">Fulvius Flaccus</persName> in his consulship first and foremost openly excited among the Italians the desire for Roman citizenship, so as to be partners in the empire instead of subjects. When he introduced this idea and strenuously persisted in it, the Senate, for that reason, sent him away to take command in a war, in the course of which his consulship expired; but he obtained the tribuneship after that and contrived to have the younger <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> for a colleague, with whose co-operation he brought forward other measures in favour of the Italians. When they were both killed, as I have previously related, the Italians were still more excited. They could not bear to be considered subjects instead of equals, or to think that <persName n="174">Fulvius Flaccus</persName> and <persName n="191">Gaius Gracchus</persName> should have suffered such calamities while working for their political advantage.

35 1 After them the tribune <persName n="269">Livius Drusus</persName>, a man of most illustrious birth, promised the Italians, at their urgent request, that he would bring forward a new law to give them citizenship. They especially desired this because by that one step they would become rulers instead of subjects. In order to conciliate the plebeians to this measure he led out to Italy and Sicily several colonies which had been voted some time before, but not yet planted. He endeavoured to bring together by an agreement the Senate and the equestrian order, who were then in sharp antagonism to each other, in reference to the law courts. As he was not able to restore the courts to the Senate openly, he tried the following artifice to reconcile them. As the senators had been reduced by the seditions to scarcely 300 in number, he brought forward a law that an equal number, chosen according to merit, should be added to their enrolment from the knights, and that the courts of justice should be made up thereafter from the whole number. He added a clause in the law that they should make investigations about bribery, as accusations of that kind were almost unknown, since the custom of bribe-taking prevailed without restraint.

This was the plan that he contrived for both of them, but it turned out contrary to his expectations, for the senators were indignant that so large a number should be added to their enrolment at one time and be transferred from knighthood to the highest rank. They thought it not unlikely that they would form a faction in the Senate by themselves and contend against the old senators more powerfully than ever. The knights, on the other hand, suspected that, by this doctoring, the courts of justice would be transferred from their order to the Senate exclusively. Having acquired a relish for the great gains and power of the judicial office, this suspicion disturbed them. Most of them, too, fell into doubt and distrust toward each other, discussing which of them seemed more worthy than others to be enrolled among the 300; and envy against their betters filled the breasts of the remainder. Above all the knights were angry at the revival of the charge of bribery, which they thought had been ere this entirely suppressed, so far as they were concerned.

36 1 Thus it came to pass that both the Senate and the knights, although opposed to each other, were united in hating <persName n="269">Livius Drusus</persName>. Only the plebeians were gratified with the colonies. Even the Italians, in whose especial interest <persName n="269">Livius Drusus</persName> was devising these plans, were apprehensive about the law providing for the colonies, because they thought that the Roman public domain (which was still undivided and which they were cultivating, some by force and others clandestinely) would at once be taken away from them, and that in many cases they might even be disturbed in their private holdings. The Etruscans and the Umbrians had the same fears as the Italians, and when they were summoned to the city, as was thought, by the consuls, for the ostensible purpose of complaining against the law of <persName n="269">Livius Drusus</persName>, but actually to kill him, they cried down the law publicly and waited for the day of the comitia. <persName n="269">Livius Drusus</persName> learned of the plot against him and did not go out frequently, but transacted business from day to day in the atrium of his house, which was poorly lighted. One evening as he was sending the crowd away he exclaimed suddenly that he was wounded, and fell down while uttering the words. A shoemaker's knife was found thrust into his hip.

37 1 Thus was <persName n="269">Livius Drusus</persName> also slain while serving as tribune. The knights, in order to make his policy a ground of vexatious accusation against their enemies, persuaded the tribune <persName n="483">Quintus Varius</persName> to bring forward a law to prosecute those who should, either openly or secretly, aid the Italians to acquire citizenship, hoping thus to bring all the senators under an odious indictment, and themselves to sit in judgment on them, and that when they were out of the way they themselves would be more powerful than ever in the government of Rome. When the other tribunes interposed their veto the knights surrounded them with drawn daggers and enacted the measure, whereupon accusers at once brought actions against the most illustrious of the senators. Of these <persName n="95">Calpurnius Bestia</persName> did not respond, but went into exile voluntarily rather than surrender himself into the hands of his enemies. After him <persName n="615">Cotta</persName> went before the court, made an impressive defence of his administration of public affairs, and openly reviled the knights. He, too, departed from the city before the vote of the judges was taken. <persName n="377">Mummius Achaicus</persName>, the conqueror of Greece, was basely ensnared by the knights, who promised to acquit him, but condemned him to banishment. He passed the remainder of his life at Delos.

38 1 As this malice against the aristocracy grew more and more, the people were grieved because they were deprived all at once of so many distinguished men who had rendered such great services. When the Italians learned of the murder of <persName n="269">Livius Drusus</persName> and of the reasons alleged for banishing the others, they considered it no longer tolerable that those who were labouring for their political advancement should suffer such outrages, and as they saw no other means of acquiring citizenship they decided to revolt from the Romans altogether, and to make war against them with might and main. They sent envoys secretly to each other, and formed a league, and exchanged hostages as a pledge of good faith.

The Romans were in ignorance of these facts for a long time, being busy with the trials and the seditions in the city. When they heard what was going on they sent men round to the towns, choosing those who were best acquainted with each, to collect information quietly. One of these agents saw a young man who was being taken as a hostage from the town of Asculum to another town, and informed <persName n="481">Quintus Servilius</persName>, the praetor, who was in those parts. (It appears that there were praetors with consular power at that time governing the various parts of Italy; the emperor <persName n="224">Hadrian</persName> revived the custom a long time afterward, but it did not long survive him.) <persName n="481">Quintus Servilius</persName> hastened to Asculum and indulged in very menacing language to the people, who were celebrating a festival, and they, supposing that the plot was discovered, put him to death. They also killed <persName n="169">Fonteius</persName>, his legate (for so they call those of the senatorial order who accompany the governors of provinces as assistants). After these were slain none of the other Romans in Asculum were spared. The inhabitants fell upon them, slaughtered them all, and plundered their goods.

39 1 When the revolt broke out all the neighbouring peoples declared war at the same time, the Marsi, the Peligni, the Vestini, the Marrucini; and after them the Picentines, the Frentani, the Hirpini, the Pompeiians, the Venusini, the Apulians, the Lucanians, and the Samnites, all of whom had been hostile to the Romans before; also all the rest extending from the river Liris (which is now, I think, the Liternus) to the extremity of the Adriatic gulf, both inland and on the sea coast.18 They sent ambassadors to Rome to complain that although they had co-operated in all ways with the Romans in building up the empire, the latter had not been willing to admit their helpers to citizenship. The Senate answered sternly that if they repented of what they had done they could send ambassadors, otherwise not. The Italians, in despair of any other remedy, went on with their mobilization. Besides the soldiers which were kept for guards at each town, they had forces in common amounting to about 100,000 foot and horse. The Romans sent an equal force against them, made up of their own citizens and of the Italian peoples who were still in alliance with them.

40 1 The Romans were led by the consuls <persName n="535">Sextus Julius Caesar</persName> and <persName n="495">Rutilius</persName>, for in this great civil war both consuls marched forth at once, leaving the gates and walls in charge of others, as was customary in cases of danger arising at home and very near by. When the war was found to be complex and many-sided, they sent their most renowned men as lieutenant-generals to aid the consuls: to <persName n="495">Rutilius</persName>, <persName n="424">Pompey Strabo</persName>, the father of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, <persName n="88">Caepio</persName>, <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName>, <persName n="602">Marius</persName>, and <persName n="585">Valerius Messala</persName>; to <persName n="535">Sextus Julius Caesar</persName>, <persName n="450">Publius Lentulus</persName>, as well as <persName n="572">Titus Didius</persName>, <persName n="267">Licinius Crassus</persName>, <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, and <persName n="588">Marcellus</persName>. All these served under the consuls and the country was divided among them. The consuls visited all parts of the field of operations, and the Romans sent them additional forces continually, realizing that it was a serious conflict. The Italians had generals for their united forces besides those of the separate towns. The chief commanders were <persName n="573">Titus Lafrenius</persName>, <persName n="201">Gaius Pontilius</persName>, <persName n="348">Marius Egnatius</persName>, <persName n="480">Quintus Popaedius</persName>, <persName n="200">Gaius Papius</persName>, <persName n="337">Marcus Lamponius</persName>, <persName n="208">Gaius Vidacilius</persName>, <persName n="230">Herius Asinius</persName>, and <persName n="596">Vettius Scaton</persName>. They divided their army in equal parts, took their positions against the Roman generals, performed many notable exploits, and suffered many disasters. The most memorable events of either kind I shall here summarize.

41 1 <persName n="596">Vettius Scaton</persName> defeated <persName n="535">Sextus Julius Caesar</persName>, killed 200 of his men, and marched against Aesernia, which adhered to Rome. <persName n="307">Lucius Scipio</persName> and <persName n="273">Lucius Acilius</persName>, who were in command here, escaped in the disguise of slaves. The enemy, after a considerable time, reduced it by famine. <persName n="348">Marius Egnatius</persName> captured Venafrum by treachery and slew two Roman cohorts there. <persName n="453">Publius Presentaeus</persName> defeated <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName>, who had 10,000 men under his command, killed 4000 and captured the arms of the greater part of the others, for which reason the consul <persName n="495">Rutilius</persName> deprived <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName> of his command and gave his division of the army to <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName>. <persName n="337">Marcus Lamponius</persName> destroyed some 800 of the forces under <persName n="267">Licinius Crassus</persName> and drove the remainder into the town of Grumentum.

42 1 <persName n="200">Gaius Papius</persName> captured Nola by treachery and offered to the 2000 Roman soldiers in it the privilege of serving under him if they would change their allegiance. They did so, but their officers refusing the proposal were taken prisoners and starved to death by <persName n="200">Gaius Papius</persName>. He also captured Stabiae, Minervium, and Salernum, which was a Roman colony. The prisoners and the slaves from these places were taken into the military service. But when he also plundered the entire country around Nuceria, the towns in the vicinity were struck with terror and submitted to him, and when he demanded military assistance they furnished him about 10,000 foot and 1000 horse. With these <persName n="200">Gaius Papius</persName> laid siege to Acerrae. When <persName n="535">Sextus Julius Caesar</persName>, with 10,000 Gallic foot and Numidian and Mauretanian horse and foot, advanced towards Acerrae, <persName n="200">Gaius Papius</persName> took a son of <persName n="244">Jugurtha</persName>, formerly king of Numidia, named <persName n="395">Oxynta</persName>, who was under charge of a Roman guard at Venusia, led him out of that place, clothed him in royal purple, and showed him frequently to the Numidians who were in <persName n="535">Sextus Julius Caesar</persName>'s army. Many of them deserted, as if to their own king, so that <persName n="535">Sextus Julius Caesar</persName> was obliged to send the rest back to Africa, as they were not trustworthy. But when <persName n="200">Gaius Papius</persName> attacked him contemptuously, and had already made a breach in his palisaded camp, <persName n="535">Sextus Julius Caesar</persName> debouched with his horse through the other gates and slew about 6000 of his men, after which <persName n="535">Sextus Julius Caesar</persName> withdrew from Acerrae. Canusia and Venusia and many other towns in Apulia sided with Vidacilius. Some that did not submit he besieged, and he put to death the principal Roman citizens in them, but the common people and the slaves he enrolled in his army.

43 1 The consul <persName n="495">Rutilius</persName> and <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName> built bridges over the river Liris at no great distance from each other. <persName n="596">Vettius Scaton</persName> pitched his camp opposite them, but nearer to the bridge of <persName n="602">Marius</persName>, and placed an ambush by night in some ravines near the bridge of <persName n="495">Rutilius</persName>. Early in the morning, after he had allowed <persName n="495">Rutilius</persName> to cross the bridge, he started up from ambush and killed a large number of the enemy on the dry land and drove many into the river. In this fight <persName n="495">Rutilius</persName> himself was wounded in the head by a missile and died soon afterward. <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName> was on the other bridge and when he guessed, from the bodies floating down stream, what had happened, he drove back those in his front, crossed the river, and captured the camp of <persName n="596">Vettius Scaton</persName>, which was guarded by only a small force, so that <persName n="596">Vettius Scaton</persName> was obliged to spend the night where he had won his victory, and to retreat in the morning for want of provisions. The body of <persName n="495">Rutilius</persName> and those of many other patricians were brought to Rome for burial. The corpses of the consul and his numerous comrades made a piteous spectacle and the mourning lasted many days. The Senate decreed from this time on that those who were killed in war should be buried where they fell, lest others should be deterred by the spectacle from entering the army. When the enemy heard of this they made a similar decree for themselves.


VI
44 1 There was no successor to <persName n="495">Rutilius</persName> in the consulship for the remainder of the year, as <persName n="535">Sextus Julius Caesar</persName> did not have leisure to go to the city and hold the comitia. The Senate appointed <persName n="602">Marius</persName> and <persName n="88">Caepio</persName> to command the forces of <persName n="495">Rutilius</persName> in the field. The opposing general, <persName n="480">Quintus Popaedius</persName>, fled as a pretended deserter to this <persName n="88">Caepio</persName>. He brought with him and gave as a pledge two slave babies, clad with the purple-bordered garments of free-born children, pretending that they were his own sons. As further confirmation of his good faith he brought masses of lead plated with gold and silver. He urged <persName n="88">Caepio</persName> to follow him in all haste with his army and capture the hostile army while destitute of a leader, and <persName n="88">Caepio</persName> was deceived and followed him. When they had arrived at a place where the ambush had been laid, <persName n="480">Quintus Popaedius</persName> ran up to the top of a hill as though he were searching for the enemy, and gave his own men a signal. The latter sprang out of their concealment and cut <persName n="88">Caepio</persName> and most of his force in pieces; so the Senate joined the rest of <persName n="88">Caepio</persName>'s army to that of <persName n="602">Marius</persName>.

45 1 While <persName n="535">Sextus Julius Caesar</persName> was passing through a rocky defile with 30,000 foot and 5000 horse <persName n="348">Marius Egnatius</persName> suddenly fell upon him and drove him back into it. He retired, borne on a litter, as he was ill, to a certain stream where there was only one bridge and there he lost the greater part of his force and the arms of the survivors, only escaping to Teanum with difficulty, where he armed the remainder of his men as best he could. Reinforcements were sent to him speedily and he marched to the relief of Acerrae, which was still besieged by <persName n="200">Gaius Papius</persName>.

There, though their camps were pitched opposite each other, neither dared to attack the other, 46 1 but <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> and <persName n="602">Marius</persName> defeated the Marsians, who had attacked them. They pursued the enemy vigorously as far as the walls enclosing their vineyards. The Marsians scaled these walls with heavy loss, but <persName n="602">Marius</persName> and <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> did not deem it wise to follow them farther. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> was encamped on the other side of these enclosures, and when he knew what had happened he came out to meet the Marsians, as they tried to escape, and he also killed a great number. More than 6000 Marsians were slain that day, and the arms of a still greater number were captured by the Romans.

The Marsians were rendered as furious as wild beasts by this disaster. They armed their forces again and prepared to march against the enemy, but did not dare to take the offensive or the begin a battle. They are a very warlike race, and it is said that no triumph was ever awarded for a victory over them except for this single disaster. There had been up to this time a saying, "No triumph over Marsians or without Marsians."

47 1 Near Mount Falernus, <persName n="208">Gaius Vidacilius</persName>, <persName n="573">Titus Lafrenius</persName> and <persName n="459">Publius Vettius</persName> united their forces and defeated <persName n="424">Pompey Strabo</persName>, pursuing him to the city of Firmum. Then they went their several ways, and <persName n="573">Titus Lafrenius</persName> besieged <persName n="424">Pompey Strabo</persName>, who had shut himself up in Firmum. The latter at once armed his remaining forces, but did not come to an engagement; when, however, he learned that another army was approaching, he sent <persName n="550">Sulpicius</persName> round to take <persName n="573">Titus Lafrenius</persName> in the rear while he made a sally in front. Battle was joined and both sides were in much distress, when <persName n="550">Sulpicius</persName> set fire to the enemy's camp. When the latter saw this they fled to Asculum in disorder and without a general, for <persName n="573">Titus Lafrenius</persName> had fallen in the battle. <persName n="424">Pompey Strabo</persName> then advanced and laid siege to Asculum.

48 1 Asculum was the native town of <persName n="208">Gaius Vidacilius</persName>, and as he feared for its safety he hastened to its relief with eight cohorts. He sent word beforehand to the inhabitants that when they should see him advancing at a distance they should make a sally against the besiegers, so that the enemy should be attacked on both sides at once. The inhabitants were afraid to do so; nevertheless <persName n="208">Gaius Vidacilius</persName> forced his way into the city through the midst of the enemy with what followers he could get, and upbraided the citizens for their cowardice and disobedience. As he despaired of saving the city he first put to death all of his enemies who had been at variance with him before and who, out of jealousy, had prevented the people from obeying his recent orders. Then he erected a funeral pile in the temple and placed a couch upon it, and held a feast with his friends, and while the drinking-bout was at its height he swallowed poison, threw himself on the pile, and ordered his friends to set fire to it. Thus perished <persName n="208">Gaius Vidacilius</persName>, a man who considered it glorious to die for his country, <persName n="535">Sextus Julius Caesar</persName> was invested with the consular power by the Senate after his term of office had expired. He attacked 20,000 of the enemy while they were changing camping-places, killed about 8000 of them, and captured the arms of a much larger number. He died of disease while pushing the long siege of Asculum; the Senate appointed <persName n="180">Gaius Baebius</persName> his successor.

49 1 While these events were transpiring on the Adriatic side of Italy, the inhabitants of Etruria and Umbria and other neighbouring peoples on the other side of Rome heard of them and all were excited to revolt. The Senate, fearing lest they should be surrounded by war, and unable to protect themselves, garrisoned the sea-coast from Cumae to the city with freedmen, who were then for the first time enrolled in the army on account of the scarcity of soldiers. The Senate also voted that those Italians who had adhered to their alliance should be admitted to citizenship, which was the one thing they all desired most. They sent this decree around among the Etruscans, who gladly accepted the citizenship. By this favour the Senate made the faithful more faithful, confirmed the wavering, and mollified their enemies by the hope of similar treatment. The Romans did not enroll the new citizens in the thirty-five existing tribes, lest they should outvote the old ones in the elections, but incorporated them in ten new tribes, which voted last. So it often happened that their vote was useless, since a majority was obtained from the thirty-five tribes that voted first. This fact was either not noticed by the Italians at the time or they were satisfied with what they had gained, but it was observed later and became the source of a new conflict.

50 1 The insurgents along the Adriatic coast, before they learned of the change of sentiment among the Etruscans, sent 15,000 men to their assistance by a long and difficult road. <persName n="424">Pompey Strabo</persName>, who was now consul, fell upon them and killed 5000 of them. The rest made their way homeward through a trackless region, in a severe winter; and half of them after subsisting on acorns perished. The same winter <persName n="432">Porcius Cato</persName>, the colleague of <persName n="424">Pompey Strabo</persName>, was killed while fighting with the Marsians. While <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> was encamped near the Pompaean hills <persName n="290">Lucius Cluentius</persName> pitched his camp in a contemptuous manner at a distance of only three stades from him. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> did not tolerate this insolence, but attacked <persName n="290">Lucius Cluentius</persName> without waiting for his own foragers to come in. He was worsted and put to flight, but when he was reinforced by his foragers he turned and defeated <persName n="290">Lucius Cluentius</persName>. The latter then moved his camp to a greater distance. Having received certain Gallic reinforcements he again drew near to <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> and just as the two armies were coming to an engagement a Gaul of enormous size advanced and challenged any Roman to single combat. A Maurusian soldier of short stature accepted the challenge and killed him, whereupon the Gauls became panic-stricken and fled. <persName n="290">Lucius Cluentius</persName>' line of battle was thus broken and the remainder of his troops did not stand their ground, but fled in disorder to Nola. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> followed them and killed 3000 in the pursuit, and as the inhabitants of Nola received them by only one gate, lest the enemy should rush in with them, he killed about 20,000 more outside the walls and among them <persName n="290">Lucius Cluentius</persName> himself, who fell fighting bravely.

Then <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> moved against another tribe, the Hirpini, and attacked the town of Aeculanum. The inhabitants, who expected aid from the Lucanians that very day, asked <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> to give them time for consideration. He understood the trick and gave them one hour, and meanwhile piled fagots around their walls, which were made of wood, and at the expiration of the hour set them on fire. They were terrified and surrendered the town. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> plundered it because it had not been delivered up voluntarily but under necessity. He spared the other towns that gave themselves up, and in this way the entire population of the Hirpini was brought under subjection. Then <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> moved against the Samnites, not where <persName n="380">Mutilus</persName>, the Samnite general, guarded the roads, but by another circuitous route where his coming was not expected. He fell upon them suddenly, killed many, and scattered the rest in disorderly flight. <persName n="380">Mutilus</persName> was wounded and took refuge with a few followers in Aesernia. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> destroyed his camp and moved against Bovanum, where the common council of the rebels was held. The city had three citadels. While the inhabitants were intently watching <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> from one of these citadels, he ordered a detachment to capture whichever of the other two they could, and then to make a signal by means of smoke. When the smoke was seen he made an attack in front and, after a severe fight of three hours, took the city.

52 1 These were the successes of <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> during that summer. When winter came he returned to Rome to stand for the consulship, but <persName n="424">Pompey Strabo</persName> brought the Marsians, the Marrucini, and the Vestini under subjection. <persName n="130">Cosconius</persName>, another Roman par, advanced against Salapia and burned it. He received the surrender of Cannae and laid siege to Canusium; then he had a severe fight with the Samnites, who came to its relief, and after great slaughter on both sides <persName n="130">Cosconius</persName> was beaten and retreated to Cannae. A river separated the two armies, and <persName n="578">Trebatius</persName> sent word to <persName n="130">Cosconius</persName> either to come over to his side and fight him, or to withdraw and let him cross. <persName n="130">Cosconius</persName> withdrew, and while <persName n="578">Trebatius</persName> was crossing attacked him and got the better of him, and, while he was escaping toward the stream, killed 15,000 of his men. The remainder took refuge with <persName n="578">Trebatius</persName> in Canusium. <persName n="130">Cosconius</persName> overran the territory of Larinum, Venusia, and Asculum, and invaded that of the Poediculi, and within two days received their surrender.

53 1 <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName>, his successor in the praetorship, attacked the Apulians and overcame them in battle. <persName n="480">Quintus Popaedius</persName>, one of the rebel generals, here lost his life, and the survivors joined <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> in detachments. Such was the course of events throughout Italy as regards the Social War, which had raged with violence thus far, until the whole of Italy came into the Roman state except, for the present, the Lucanians and the Samnites, who also seem to have obtained what they desired somewhat later. Each body of allies was enrolled in tribes of its own, like those who had been admitted to citizenship before, so that they might not, by being mingled with the old citizens, vote them down in the elections by force of numbers.

54 1 About the same time dissensions arose in the city between debtors and creditors, since the latter exacted the money due to them with interest, although an old law distinctly forbade lending on interest and imposed a penalty upon any one doing so. It seems that the ancient Romans, like the Greeks, abhorred the taking of interest on loans as something knavish, and hard on the poor, and leading to contention and enmity; and by the same kind of reasoning the Persians considered lending as having itself a tendency to deceit and lying. But, since time had sanctioned the practice of taking interest, the creditors demanded it according to custom. The debtors, on the other hand, put off their payments on the plea of war and civil commotion. Some indeed threatened to exact the legal penalty from the interest-takers.

The praetor <persName n="54">Asellio</persName>, who had charge of these matters, as he was not able to compose their differences by persuasion, allowed them to proceed against each other in the courts, thus bringing the deadlock due to the conflict of law and custom before the judges. The lenders, exasperated that the now obsolete law was being revived, killed the praetor in the following manner. He was offering sacrifice to Castor and Pollux in the forum, with a crowd standing around as was usual at such a ceremony. In the first place somebody threw a stone at him, on which he dropped the libation-bowl and ran toward the temple of Vesta. They then got ahead of him and prevented him from reaching the temple, and after he had fled into a tavern they cut his throat. Many of his pursuers, thinking that he had taken refuge with the Vestal virgins, ran in there, where it was not lawful for men to go. Thus was <persName n="54">Asellio</persName>, while serving as praetor, and pouring out libation, and wearing the sacred gilded vestments customary in such ceremonies, slain at the second hour of the day in the centre of the forum, in the midst of the sacrifice. The Senate offered a reward of money to any free citizen, freedom to any slave, impunity to any accomplice, who should give testimony leading to the conviction of the murders of <persName n="54">Asellio</persName>, but nobody gave any information. The money-lenders covered up everything.


VII
55 1 Hitherto the murders and seditions had been internal and fragmentary. Afterward the chiefs of factions assailed each other with great armies, according to the usage of war, and their country lay as a prize between them. The beginning and origin of these contentions came about directly after the Social War, in this wise.

When <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName>, king of Pontus and of other nations, invaded Bithynia and Phrygia and that part of Asia adjacent to those countries, as I have related in the preceding book, the consul <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> was chosen by lot to the command of Asia and the Mithridatic war, but was still in Rome. <persName n="602">Marius</persName>, for his part, thought that this would be an easy and lucrative war and desiring the command of it prevailed upon the tribune, <persName n="550">Sulpicius</persName>, by many promises, to help him to obtain it. He also encouraged the new Italian citizens, who had very little power in the elections, to hope that they should be distributed among all the tribes — not in any way openly suggesting his own advantage, but with the expectation of employing them as loyal servants for all his ends. <persName n="550">Sulpicius</persName> straightway brought forward a law for this purpose. If it were enacted <persName n="602">Marius</persName> and <persName n="550">Sulpicius</persName> would have everything they wanted, because the new citizens far outnumbered the old ones. The old citizens saw this and opposed the new ones with all their might. They fought each other with sticks and stones, and the evil increased continually, till the consuls, becoming apprehensive, as the day for voting on the law drew near, proclaimed a vacation of several days, such as was customary on festal occasions, in order to postpone the voting and the danger.

56 1 <persName n="550">Sulpicius</persName> would not wait for the end of the vacation, but ordered his faction to come to the forum with concealed daggers and to do whatever the exigency might require, sparing not even the consuls if need be. When everything was in readiness he denounced the vacations as illegal and ordered the consuls, <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> and <persName n="478">Quintus Pompeius</persName>, to put an end to them at once, in order to proceed to the enactment of the laws. A tumult arose, and those who had been armed drew their daggers and threatened to kill the consuls, who refused to obey. Finally <persName n="478">Quintus Pompeius</persName> escaped secretly and <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> withdrew on the pretext of taking advice. In the meantime <persName n="421">Pompeius</persName>, the son of <persName n="478">Quintus Pompeius</persName>, who was the son-in‑law of <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, and who was speaking his mind rather freely, was killed by the Sulpicians. Presently <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> came on the scene and, having annulled the vacation, hurried away to Capua, where his army was stationed, as if to cross over to Asia to take command of the war against <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName>, for he knew nothing as yet of the designs against himself. As the vacation was annulled and <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> had left the city, <persName n="550">Sulpicius</persName> enacted his law, and <persName n="602">Marius</persName>, for whose sake it was done, was forthwith chosen commander of the war against <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName> in place of <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>.

57 1 When <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> heard of this he resolved to decide the question by war, and called the army together to a conference. They were eager for the war against <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName> because it promised much plunder, and they feared that <persName n="602">Marius</persName> would enlist other soldiers instead of themselves. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> spoke of the indignity put upon him by <persName n="550">Sulpicius</persName> and <persName n="602">Marius</persName>, and while he did not openly allude to anything else (for he did not dare as yet to mention this sort of war), he urged them to be ready to obey his orders. They understood what he meant, and as they feared lest they should miss the campaign they uttered boldly what <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> had in mind, and told him to be of good courage, and to lead them to Rome. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> was overjoyed and led six legions thither forthwith; but all his superior officers, except one quaestor, left him and fled to the city, because they would not submit to the idea of leading an army against their country. Envoys met him on the road and asked him why he was marching with armed forces against his country. "To deliver her from tyrants," he replied.

He gave the same answer to a second and third embassy that came to him, one after another, but he announced to them finally that the Senate and <persName n="602">Marius</persName> and <persName n="550">Sulpicius</persName> might meet him in the Campus Martius if they liked, and that he would do whatever might be agreed upon after consultation. As he was approaching, his colleague, <persName n="478">Quintus Pompeius</persName>, came to meet and congratulate him, and to offer his whole-hearted hope, for he was delighted with the steps he was taking. As <persName n="602">Marius</persName> and <persName n="550">Sulpicius</persName> needed some short interval for preparation, they sent other messengers, also in the guise of envoys from the Senate, directing him not to move his camp nearer than forty stades from the city until they could review the state of affairs. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> and <persName n="478">Quintus Pompeius</persName> understood their motive perfectly and promised to comply, but as soon as the envoys withdrew they followed them.

58 1 <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> took possession of the Esquiline gate and of the adjoining wall with one legion of soldiers, and <persName n="478">Quintus Pompeius</persName> occupied the Colline gate with another. A third advanced to the Wooden bridge, and a fourth remained on guard in front of the walls. With the remainder <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> entered the city, in appearance and in fact an enemy. Those in the neighbouring houses tried to keep him off by hurling missiles from the roofs until he threatened to burn the houses; then they desisted. <persName n="602">Marius</persName> and <persName n="550">Sulpicius</persName> went, with some forces they had hastily armed, to meet the invaders near the Esquiline forum, and here a battle took place between the contending parties, the first regularly fought in Rome with bugle and standards in full military fashion, no longer like a mere faction fight. To such extremity of evil had the recklessness of party strife progressed among them.

<persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s forces were beginning to waver when <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> seized a standard and exposed himself to danger in the foremost ranks, so that from regard for their general and fear of ignominy, should they abandon their standard, they might rally at once. Then he ordered up the fresh troops from his camp and sent others around by the Suburran road to take the enemy in the rear. The Marians fought feebly against these new-comers, and as they feared lest they should be surrounded they called to their aid the other citizens who were still fighting from the houses, and proclaimed freedom to slaves who would share their dangers. As nobody came forward they fell into utter despair and fled at once out of the city, together with those of the nobility who had co-operated with them.

59 1 <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> advanced to the Via Sacra, and there, in sight of everybody, punished at once certain soldiers for looting things they had come across. He stationed guards at intervals throughout the city, he and <persName n="478">Quintus Pompeius</persName> keeping watch by night. Each kept moving about his own command to see that no calamity was brought about either by the frightened people or by the victorious troops. At daybreak they summoned the people to an assembly and lamented the condition of the republic, which had been so long given over to demagogues, and said that they had done what they had done as a matter of necessity. They proposed that no question should ever again be brought before the people which had not been previously considered by the Senate, an ancient practice which had been abandoned long ago; also that the voting should not be by tribes, but by centuries, as <persName n="526">King Servius Tullius</persName> had ordained. They thought that by these two measures — namely, that no law should be brought before the people unless it had been previously before the Senate, and that the voting should be controlled by the well-to‑do and sober-minded rather than by the pauper and reckless classes — there would no longer be left any starting-point for civil discord. They proposed many other measures for curtailing the power of the tribunes, which had become extremely tyrannical, and enrolled 300 of the best citizens at once in the list of the senators, who had been reduced at that time to a very small number and had fallen into contempt for that reason. They also annulled all the acts performed by <persName n="550">Sulpicius</persName> after the vacation had been proclaimed by the consuls, as being illegal.

60 1 Thus the seditions proceeded from strife and contention to murder, and from murder to open war, and now the first army of her own citizens had invaded Rome as a hostile country. From this time the seditions were decided only by the arbitrament of arms. There were frequent attacks upon the city and battles before the walls and other calamities incident to war. Henceforth there was no restraint upon violence either from the sense of shame, or regard for law, institutions, or country. This time <persName n="550">Sulpicius</persName>, who still held the office of tribune, together with <persName n="602">Marius</persName>, who had been consul six times, and his son <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName>, also <persName n="446">Publius Cethegus</persName>, <persName n="247">Junius Brutus</persName>, <persName n="196">Gnaeus Granius</persName> and <persName n="472">Quintus Granius</persName>, <persName n="444">Publius Albinovanus</persName>, <persName n="336">Marcus Laetorius</persName>, and others with them, about twelve in number, had been exiled from Rome, because they had stirred up the sedition, had borne arms against the consuls, had incited slaves to insurrection, and had been voted enemies of the Roman people; and anybody meeting them had been authorized to kill them with impunity or to drag them before the consuls, while their goods had been confiscated.

Detectives, too, were hard on their tracks, who caught <persName n="550">Sulpicius</persName> and killed him, but 61 1 <persName n="602">Marius</persName> escaped them and fled to Minturnae without companion or servant. While he was resting in a darkened house the magistrates of the city, whose fears were excited by the proclamation of the Roman people, but who hesitated to be the murderers of a man who had been six times consul and had performed so many brilliant exploits, sent a Gaul who was living there to kill him with a sword. The Gaul, it is said, was approaching the pallet of <persName n="602">Marius</persName> in the dusk when he thought he saw the gleam and flash of fire darting from his eyes, and <persName n="602">Marius</persName> rose from his bed and shouted to him in a thundering voice, "Do you dare to kill <persName n="602">Marius</persName>?" He turned and fled out of doors like a madman, exclaiming, "I cannot kill <persName n="602">Marius</persName>." The magistrates had come to their private decision with reluctance, and now a kind of religious awe came over them as they remembered the prophecy uttered while he was a boy, that he should be consul seven times. For it was said that while he was a boy seven eaglets alighted on his breast, and that the soothsayers predicted that he would attain the highest office seven times.

62 1 Bearing these things in mind and believing that the Gaul had been inspired with fear by divine influence, the magistrates of Minturnae sent <persName n="602">Marius</persName> out of the town forthwith, to seek safety wherever he could. As he knew that <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> was searching for him and that horsemen were pursuing him, he moved toward the sea by unfrequented roads and came to a hut where he rested, covering himself up with leaves. Hearing a slight noise, he concealed himself more carefully with the leaves, but becoming more sure he rushed to the boat of an old fisherman, which was on the beach, overpowered him, leaped into it, and, although a storm was raging, cut the painter, spread the sail, and committed himself to chance. He was driven to an island where he found a ship navigated by his own friends, and sailed thence to Africa. He was prohibited from landing even there by the governor, <persName n="528">Sextilius</persName>, because he was a public enemy, and he passed the winter in his ship a little beyond the province of Africa, in Numidia. While he was sailing thither he was joined by <persName n="446">Publius Cethegus</persName>, <persName n="216">Gnaeus Granius</persName>, <persName n="444">Publius Albinovanus</persName>, <persName n="336">Marcus Laetorius</persName>, and others, and his son <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName>, who had gained tidings of his approach. They had fled from Rome to <persName n="232">Hiempsal</persName> prince of Numidia, and now they had run away from him, fearing lest they should be delivered up.

They were ready to do just as <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> had done, that is, to master their country by force, but as they had no army they waited for some opportunity; 63 1 but in Rome <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, who had been the first to seize the city by force of arms, and now perhaps could have wielded supreme power, having rid himself of his enemies, desisted from violence of his own accord. He sent his army forward to Capua and resumed consular authority. The supporters of the banished faction, especially the rich, and many wealthy women, who now found a respite from the terror of arms, bestirred themselves for the return of the exiles. They spared neither pains nor expense to this end, even conspiring against the persons of the consuls, since they thought they could not secure the recall of their friends while the consuls survived. For <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> the army, which had been voted for the Mithridatic war, furnished ample protection even after he should cease to be consul; but the people commiserated the perilous position of the other consul, <persName n="478">Quintus Pompeius</persName>, and gave him the command of Italy and of the army appertaining to it, which was then under <persName n="424">Pompey Strabo</persName>. When the latter learned this he was greatly displeased, but received <persName n="478">Quintus Pompeius</persName> in the camp, and, when next day <persName n="478">Quintus Pompeius</persName> began to take over his duties, he gave way to him for a time as if relieved of his command; but a little later a crowd that had collected around the consul under pretence of listening to him killed him. After the guilty ones had fled, <persName n="424">Pompey Strabo</persName> came to the camp in a high state of indignation over the illegal killing of a consul, but despite his displeasure he forthwith resumed his command over them.24



VIII
64 1 When the murder of <persName n="478">Quintus Pompeius</persName> was reported in the city, <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> became apprehensive for his own safety and was surrounded by friends wherever he went, and had them with him even by night. He did not, however, remain long in the city, but went to the army at Capua and from thence to Asia, and the friends of the exiles, encouraged by <persName n="111">Cinna</persName>, <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s successor in the consulship, excited the new citizens in favour of the scheme of <persName n="602">Marius</persName>, that they should be distributed among all the old tribes, so that they should not be powerless by reason of voting last. This was preliminary to the recall of <persName n="602">Marius</persName> and his friends. Although the old citizens resisted with all their might, <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> co-operated with the new ones, the story being that he had been bribed with 300 talents to do this. The other consul, <persName n="389">Octavius</persName>, sided with the old citizens. The partisans of <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> took possession of the forum with concealed daggers, and with loud cries demanded that they should be distributed among all the tribes. The more reputable part of the plebeians adhered to <persName n="389">Octavius</persName>, and they also carried daggers.

While <persName n="389">Octavius</persName> was still at home awaiting the result, the news was brought to him that the majority of the tribunes had vetoed the proposed action, but that the new citizens had started a riot, drawn their daggers on the street, and assaulted the opposing tribunes on the rostra. When <persName n="389">Octavius</persName> heard this he ran down through the Via Sacra with a very dense mass of men, burst into the forum like a torrent, pushed through the midst of the crowd, and separated them. He struck terror into them, went on to the temple of Castor and Pollux, and drove <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> away; while his companions fell upon the new citizens without orders, killed many of them, put the rest to flight, and pursued them to the city gates.

65 1 <persName n="111">Cinna</persName>, who had been emboldened by the numbers of the new citizens to think that he should conquer, seeing the victory won contrary to his expectation by the bravery of the few, hurried through the city calling the slaves to his assistance by an offer of freedom. As none responded he hastened to the towns near by, which had lately been admitted to Roman citizenship, Tibur, Praeneste, and the rest as far as Nola, inciting them all to revolution and collecting money for the purposes of war. While <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> was making these preparations and plan certain senators of his party joined him, among them <persName n="197">Gaius Milo</persName>, <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName>, and <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName> the younger.

The Senate decreed that since <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> had left the city in danger while holding the office of consul, and had offered freedom to the slaves, he should no longer be consul, or even a citizen, and elected in his stead <persName n="299">Lucius Merula</persName>, the priest of Jupiter. It is said that this priest alone wore the flamen's ca at all times, the others wearing it only during sacrifices. <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> proceeded to Capua, where there was another Roman army, whose officers together with the senators who were present, he tried to win over. He went to meet them as consul in an assembly, where he laid down the fasces as though he were a private citizen, and shedding tears, said, "From you, citizens, I received this authority. The people voted it to me; the Senate has taken it away from me without your consent. Although I am the sufferer by this wrong I grieve amid my own troubles equally for your sakes. What need is there that we should solicit the favour of the tribes in the elections hereafter? What need have we of you? Where will after this be your power in the assemblies, in the elections, in the choice of consuls, if you fail to confirm what you bestow, and whenever you give your decision fail to secure it."

66 1 He said this to stir them up, and after exciting much pity for himself he rent his garments, leaped down from the rostra, and threw himself on the ground before them, where he lay a long time. Entirely overcome they raised him up; they restored him to the curule chair; they lifted up the fasces and bade him be of good cheer, as he was consul still, and lead them wherever he would. The tribunes, striking while the iron was hot, themselves took the military oath to support <persName n="111">Cinna</persName>, and administered it each to the soldiers under him. Now that this was all secure, <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> traversed the allied cities and stirred them up also, alleging that it was on their account chiefly that this misfortune had happened to him. They furnished him both money and soldiers; and many others, even of the aristocratic party in Rome, to whom the stability of the government was irksome, came and joined him.

While <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> was thus occupied, the consuls, <persName n="389">Octavius</persName> and <persName n="299">Lucius Merula</persName>, fortified the city with trenches, repaired the walls, and planted engines on them. To raise an army they sent round to the towns that were still faithful and also to Nearer Gaul, and summoned <persName n="424">Pompey Strabo</persName>, the proconsul who commanded the army on the Adriatic, to hasten to the aid of his country.

67 1 So <persName n="424">Pompey Strabo</persName> came and encamped before the Colline gate. <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> advanced against him and encamped near him. When <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName> heard of all this he sailed to Etruria with his fellow-exiles and about 500 slaves who had joined their masters from Rome. Still squalid and long-haired, he marched through the towns presenting a pitiable appearance, descanting on his battles, his victories over the Cimbri, and his six consulships; and what was extremely pleasing to them, promising, with all appearance of genuineness, to be faithful to their interests in the matter of the vote. In this way he collected 6000 Etruscans and reached <persName n="111">Cinna</persName>, who received him gladly by reason of their common interest in the present enterprise. After joining forces they encamped on the banks of the Tiber and divided their army into three parts: <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> and <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> opposite the city, <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> above it, and <persName n="602">Marius</persName> toward the sea. The two latter threw bridges across the river in order to cut off the city's food-supply. <persName n="602">Marius</persName> captured and plundered Ostia, while <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> sent a force and captured Ariminum in order to prevent an army coming to the city from the subject Gauls.

68 1 The consuls were alarmed. They needed more troops, but they were unable to summon <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> because he had already crossed over to Asia. They, however, ordered <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName>, who was carrying on what was left of the Social War against the Samnites, to make peace on the best terms he could, and come to the rescue of his beleaguered country. But <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> would not agree to the Samnites' demands, and when <persName n="602">Marius</persName> heard of this he made an engagement with them to grant all that they asked from <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName>. In this way the Samnites also became allies of <persName n="602">Marius</persName>. <persName n="35">Appius Claudius</persName>, a military tribune, who had command of the defences of Rome at the Janiculum hill, had once received a favour from <persName n="602">Marius</persName> of which the latter now reminded him, in consequence of which he admitted him into the city, opening a gate for him at about daybreak. Then <persName n="602">Marius</persName> admitted <persName n="111">Cinna</persName>. They were at once thrust out by <persName n="389">Octavius</persName> and <persName n="424">Pompey Strabo</persName>, who attacked them together, but a severe thunder-storm broke upon the camp of <persName n="424">Pompey Strabo</persName>, and he was killed by lightning together with others of the nobility.

69 1 After <persName n="602">Marius</persName> had stopped the passage of food-supplies from the sea, or by way of the river from above, he hastened to attack the neighbouring towns where grain was stored for the Romans. He fell upon their garrisons unexpectedly and captured Antium, Aricia, Lanuvium, and others. There were some also that were delivered up to him by treachery. Having in this manner obtained command of their supplies by land, he advanced boldly against Rome, by the Appian Way, before any other supplies were brought to them by another route. He and <persName n="111">Cinna</persName>, and their lieutenant-generals, <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> and <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName>, halted at a distance of 100 stades from the city and went into camp, but <persName n="389">Octavius</persName>, <persName n="267">Licinius Crassus</persName>, and <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> had taken position against them at the Alban Mount, where they watched eventualities. Although they considered themselves superior in bravery and numbers, they hesitated to risk, through haste, their country's fate on the hazard of a single battle. <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> sent heralds round the city to offer freedom to slaves who would desert to him, and forthwith a large number did desert. The Senate was alarmed, and, anticipating the most serious consequences from the people if the scarcity of corn should be protracted, changed its mind and sent envoys to <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> to treat for peace. He asked them whether they came to him as a consul or as a private citizen. They were at a loss for an answer and went back to the city; and now a large number of citizens flocked to <persName n="111">Cinna</persName>, some from fear of famine, and others because they had been previously favourable to his party and had been waiting to see which way the scales would turn.

70 1 <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> now began to despise his enemies and drew near to the wall, halting out of range, and encamped. <persName n="389">Octavius</persName> and his party were undecided and fearful, and hesitated to attack him on account of the desertions and the negotiations. The Senate was greatly perplexed and considered it a dreadful thing to depose <persName n="299">Lucius Merula</persName>, the priest of Jupiter, who had been chosen consul in place of <persName n="111">Cinna</persName>, and who had done nothing wrong in his office. Yet on account of the impending danger it reluctantly sent envoys to <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> again, and this time as consul. They no longer expected favourable terms, so they only asked that <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> should swear to them that he would abstain from bloodshed. He refused to take the oath, but he promised nevertheless that he would not willingly be the cause of anybody's death. He directed, however, that <persName n="389">Octavius</persName>, who had gone round and entered the city by another gate, should keep away from the forum lest anything should befall him against his own will. This answer he delivered to the envoys from a high platform in his character as consul. <persName n="602">Marius</persName> stood in silence beside the curule chair, but showed by the asperity of his countenance the slaughter he contemplated. When the Senate had accepted these terms and had invited <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> and <persName n="602">Marius</persName> to enter (for it was understood that, while it was <persName n="111">Cinna</persName>'s name which appeared, the moving spirit was <persName n="602">Marius</persName>), the latter said with a scornful smile that it was not lawful for men banished to enter. Forthwith the tribunes voted to repeal the decree of banishment against him and all the others who were expelled under the consulship of <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>.

71 1 Accordingly <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> and <persName n="602">Marius</persName> entered the city and everybody received them with fear. Straightway they began to plunder without hindrance all the goods of those who were supposed to be of the opposite party. <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> and <persName n="602">Marius</persName> had sworn to Octavius, and the augurs and soothsayers had predicted, that he would suffer no harm, yet his friends advised him to fly. He replied that he would never desert the city while he was consul. So he withdrew from the forum to the Janiculum with the nobility and what was left of his army, where he occupied the curule chair and wore the robes of office, attended as consul by lictors. Here he was attacked by <persName n="106">Censorinus</persName> with a body of horse, and again his friends and the soldiers who stood by him urged him to fly and brought him his horse, but he disdained even to arise, and awaited death. <persName n="106">Censorinus</persName> cut off his head and carried it to <persName n="111">Cinna</persName>, and it was suspended in the forum in front of the rostra, the first head of a consul that was so exposed. After him the heads of others who were slain were suspended there; and this shocking custom, which began with <persName n="389">Octavius</persName>, was not discontinued, but was handed down to subsequent massacres.

Now the victors sent out spies to search for their enemies of the senatorial and equestrian orders. When any knights were killed no further attention was paid to them, but all the heads of senators were exposed in front of the rostra. Neither reverence for the gods, nor the indignation of men, nor the fear of odium for their acts existed any longer among them. After committing savage deeds they turned to godless sights. They killed remorselessly and severed the necks of men already dead, and they paraded these horrors before the public eye, either to inspire fear and terror, or for a godless spectacle.

72 1 The brothers <persName n="192">Gaius Julius Caesar Strabo</persName> and <persName n="295">Lucius Julius Caesar</persName>, <persName n="59">Atilius Serranus</persName>, <persName n="450">Publius Lentulus</persName>, <persName n="199">Gaius Nemetorius</persName>, and <persName n="327">Marcus Baebius</persName> were arrested in the street and killed. <persName n="267">Licinius Crassus</persName> was pursued with his son <persName n="134">Crassus</persName>. He anticipated the pursuers by killing his son, but was himself killed by them. <persName n="322">Marcus Antonius</persName> fled to a country place, where he was concealed and entertained by a farmer, who sent his slave to a tavern for wine of a better quality than he was in the habit of buying. When the innkeeper asked him why he wanted the better quality, the slave whispered the reason to him, bought the wine, and went back. The innkeeper ran and told <persName n="602">Marius</persName>, who sprang up with joy as though he would rush to do the deed himself, but was restrained by his friends. A tribune despatched to the house sent some soldiers upstairs, whom <persName n="322">Marcus Antonius</persName>, a speaker of much charm, tried to soften with a long discourse, appealing to their pity by recalling many and various subjects, until the tribune, who was at a loss to know what had happened, rushed into the house and, finding his soldiers listening to <persName n="322">Marcus Antonius</persName>, killed him while he was still declaiming, and sent his head to <persName n="602">Marius</persName>.

73 1 <persName n="126">Cornutus</persName> concealed himself in a hut and was saved by his slaves in an ingenious way, for finding a dead body they placed it on a funeral pyre, and when the spies came set fire to it and said they were burning the body of their master, who had hanged himself. In this way he was saved by his slaves. As for <persName n="461">Quintus Ancharius</persName>, he watched his opportunity till <persName n="602">Marius</persName> was about to offer sacrifice in the Capitol, hoping that the temple would be a propitious place for reconciliation. But when he approached and saluted <persName n="602">Marius</persName>, the latter, who was just beginning the sacrifice, ordered the guards to kill him in the Capitol forthwith; and his head, with that of <persName n="322">Marcus Antonius</persName>, and those of others who had been consuls and praetors, was exposed in the forum. Burial was not permitted to any of the slain, but the bodies of men like these were torn in pieces by birds and dogs. There was, too, much private and irresponsible murder committed by the factions upon each other. There were banishments, and confiscations of property, and depositions from office, and a repeal of the laws enacted during <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s consulship. All <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s friends were put to death, his house was razed to the ground, his property confiscated, and himself voted a public enemy. Search was made for his wife and children, but they escaped. Altogether nothing was wanted to complete these wide-spread miseries.

74 1 To crown all, under the similitude of legal authority after so many had been put to death without trial, accusers were suborned to make false charges against <persName n="299">Lucius Merula</persName>, the priest of Jupiter, who was hated because he had been the successor of <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> in the consulship, although he had committed no other fault. Accusation was also brought against <persName n="193">Quintus Lutatius Catulus</persName>, who had been the colleague of <persName n="602">Marius</persName> in the war against the Cimbri, and whose life <persName n="602">Marius</persName> had once saved. It was alleged that he had been very ungrateful to <persName n="602">Marius</persName> and had been very bitter against him when he was banished. These men were put under secret surveillance, and when the day for holding court arrived were summoned to trial (the proper way was to put the accused under arrest after they had been cited four times at certain fixed intervals), but <persName n="299">Lucius Merula</persName> had opened his veins, and a tablet lying at his side showed that when he cut his veins he had removed his flamen's cap, for it was accounted a sin for the priest to wear it at his death. <persName n="193">Quintus Lutatius Catulus</persName> of free will suffocated himself with burning charcoal in a chamber newly plastered and still moist. So these two men perished. The slaves who had joined <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> in answer to his proclamation and had thereupon been freed and were at this time enrolled in the army by <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> himself, broke into and plundered houses, and killed persons whom they met in the street, some of them attacking their own masters particularly. After <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> had forbidden this several times, but without avail, he surrounded them with his Gallic soldiery one night while they were taking their rest, and killed them all.

Thus did the slaves receive fit punishment for their repeated treachery to their masters. 75 1 The following year <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> was chosen consul for the second time, and <persName n="602">Marius</persName> for the seventh; so that, notwithstanding his banishment and the price on his head, the augury of the seven eaglets proved true for him. But he died in the first month of his consulship, while forming all sorts of terrible designs against <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>. <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> caused <persName n="583">Valerius Flaccus</persName> to be chosen in his place and sent him to Asia, and when <persName n="583">Valerius Flaccus</persName> lost his life he chose <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> as his fellow-consul.


IX
76 1 <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> now hastened his return to meet his enemies, having quickly finished the war with <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName>, as I have already related. Within less than three years he had killed 160,000 men, recovered Greece, Macedonia, Ionia, Asia, and many other countries that <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName> had previously occupied, taken the king's fleet away from him, and from such vast possessions restricted him to his paternal kingdom alone. He returned with a large and well-disciplined army, devoted to him and elated by its exploits. He had an abundance of ships, money, and apparatus suitable for all emergencies, and was an object of terror to his enemies. <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> and <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> were in such fear of him that they despatched emissaries to all parts of Italy to collect money, soldiers, and supplies. They took the leading citizens into friendly intercourse and appealed especially to the newly created citizens of the towns, pretending that it was on their account that they were threatened with the present danger. They began at once to repair the ships, recalled those that were in Sicily, guarded to coast, and with fear and haste they, for their part, made preparations of every kind.

77 1 <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> wrote to the Senate in a tone of superiority recounting what he had done in Africa in the war against <persName n="244">Jugurtha</persName> the Numidian while still quaestor, as lieutenant in the Cimbric war, as praetor in Cilicia and in the Social war, and as consul. Most of all he dwelt upon his recent victories in the Mithridatic war, enumerating to them the many nations which had been under <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName> and which he had recovered for the Romans. Of nothing did he make more account than that those who had been banished from Rome by <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> had fled to him, and that he had received them in their helplessness and supported them in their affliction. In return for this, he said, he had been declared a public enemy by his foes, his house had been destroyed, his friends put to death, and his wife and children had with difficulty made their escape to him. He would be there presently to take vengeance, on behalf of themselves and of the entire city, upon the guilty ones. He assured the other citizens, and the new citizens, that he would make no complain against them.

When the letters were read fear fell upon all, and they began sending messengers to reconcile him with his enemies and to tell him in advance that, if he wanted any security, he should write to the Senate at once. They ordered <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> and <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> to cease recruiting soldiers until <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s answer should be received. They promised to do so, but as soon as the messengers had gone they proclaimed themselves consuls for the ensuing year so that they need not come back to the city earlier to hold the election. They traversed Italy, collecting soldiers whom they carried across by detachments on shipboard to Liburnia, which was to act as their base against <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>.

78 1 The first detachment had a prosperous voyage. The next encountered a storm, and those who reached land again escaped home immediately, as they did not relish the prospect of fighting their fellow-citizens. When the rest learned this they too refused to cross to Liburnia. <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> was indignant and called them to an assembly in order to terrify them, and they assembled, angry also and ready to defend themselves. One of the lictors, who was clearing the road for <persName n="111">Cinna</persName>, struck somebody who was in the way and one of the soldiers struck the lictor. <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> ordered the arrest of the offender, whereupon a clamour rose on all sides, stones were thrown at him, and those who were near him drew their dirks and stabbed him. So <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> also perished during his consulship. <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> recalled those who had been sent over by ship to Liburnia, and, through fear of what was taking place, did not go back to the city, although the tribunes summoned him with urgency to hold an election for the choice of a colleague. However, when they threatened to reduce him to the rank of a private citizen he came back and ordered the holding of the consular election, but as the omens were unfavourable he postponed it to another day. On that day lightning struck the temples of Luna and of Ceres; so the augurs prorogued the comitia beyond the summer solstice, and <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> remained sole consul.

79 1 <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> answered those who came to him from the Senate, saying that he would never be on friendly terms with the men who had committed such crimes, but would not prevent the city from extending clemency to them. As for security he said that he, with a devoted army, could better furnish lasting security to them, and to those who had fled to his camp, than they to him; whereby it was made plain in a single sentence that he would not disband his army, but was now contemplating supreme power. He demanded of them his former dignity, his property, and the priesthood, and that they should restore to him in full measure whatever other honours he had previously held. He sent some of his own men with the Senate's messengers to confer about these matters, but they, learning at Brundusium that <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> was dead and that Rome was in an unsettled state, went back to <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> without transacting their business. He then started with five legions of Italian troops and 6000 horse, to whom he added some other forces from the Peloponnesus and Macedonia, in all about 40,000 men, from the Piraeus to Patrae, and then sailed from Patrae to Brundusium in 1600 ships. The Brundusians received him without a fight, for which favour he afterward gave them exemption from customs-duties, which they enjoy to this day. Then he put his army in motion and went forward.

80 1 He was met on the road by <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName>, who had been chosen some time before to finish the Social War, but did not return to the city for fear of <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> and <persName n="602">Marius</persName>. He had been awaiting in Libya the turn of events, and now offered himself as a volunteer ally with the force under his command, as he was still a proconsul; for those who have been chosen to this office may retain it till they come back to Rome. After <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> came <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, who not long afterward was surnamed the Great, son of the <persName n="424">Pompey Strabo</persName> who was killed by lightning and who was supposed to be unfriendly to <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>. The son removed this suspicion by coming with a legion which he had collected from the territory of Picenum owing to the reputation of his father, who had been very influential there. A little later he recruited two more legions and became <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s right-hand man in these affairs. So <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> held him in honour, though still very young; and they say he never rose at the entrance of any other than this youth. When the war was nearly finished <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> sent him to Africa to drive out the party of <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> and to restore <persName n="232">Hiempsal</persName> (who had been expelled by the Numidians) to his kingdom. For this service <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> allowed him a triumph over the Numidians, although he was under age, and was still in the equestrian order. From this beginning <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> achieved greatness, being sent against Qunitus <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> in Spain and later against <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName> in Pontus. <persName n="446">Publius Cethegus</persName> also joined <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, although with <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> and <persName n="602">Marius</persName> he had been violently hostile to him and had been driven out of the city with them. He now turned suppliant, and offered his services to <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> in any capacity he might desire.

81 1 <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> now had plenty of soldiers and plenty of friends of the higher orders, whom he used as lieutenants. He and <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> marched in advance, being both proconsuls, for it seems that <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, who had been appointed proconsul against <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName>, had at no time hitherto laid down his command, although he had been voted a public enemy at the instance of <persName n="111">Cinna</persName>. Now <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> moved against his enemies with a most intense yet concealed hatred. The people in the city, who formed a pretty fair judgment of the character of the man, and who remembered his former attack and capture of the city, and who took into account the decrees they had proclaimed against him, and who had witnessed the destruction of his house, the confiscation of his property, the killing of his friends, and the narrow escape of his family, were in a state of terror. Conceiving that there was no middle ground between victory and utter destruction, they united with the consuls to resist <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, but with trepidation. They despatched messengers throughout Italy to collect soldiers, provisions, and money, and, as in cases of extreme peril, they omitted nothing that zeal and earnestness could suggest.

82 1 <persName n="386">Norbanus</persName> and <persName n="307">Lucius Scipio</persName>, who were then the consuls, and with them <persName n="100">Carbo</persName>, who had been consul the previous year (all of them moved by equal hatred of <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> and more alarmed than others because they knew that they were more to blame for what had been done), levied the best possible army from the city, joined with it the Italian army, and marched against <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> in detachments. They had 200 cohorts of 500 men at first, and their forces were considerably augmented afterward. For the sympathies of the people were much in favour of the consuls, because the action of <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, who was marching against his country, seemed to be that of an enemy, while that of the consuls, even if they were working for themselves, was ostensibly the cause of the republic. Many persons, too, who knew that they had shared the guilt, and who believed that they could not despise the fears, of the consuls, co-operated with them. They knew very well that <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> was not meditating merely punishment, correction, and alarm for them, but destruction, death, confiscation, and wholesale extermination. In this they were not mistaken, for the war ruined everyone. From 10,000 to 20,000 men were slain in a single battle more than once. Fifty thousand on both sides lost their lives round the city, and to the survivors <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> was unsparing in severity, both to individuals and to communities, until, finally, he made himself the undisputed master of the whole Roman government, so far as he wished or cared to be.

83 1 It seems, too, that divine providence foretold to them the results of this war. Mysterious terrors came upon many, both in public and in private, throughout all Italy. Ancient, awe-inspiring oracles were remembered. Many monstrous things happened. A mule foaled, a woman gave birth to a viper instead of a child. There was a severe earthquake divinely sent and some of the temples in Rome were thrown down (the Romans being in any case very seriously disposed towards such things). The Capitol, that had been built by the kings 400 years before, was burned down, and nobody could discover the cause of the fire. All things seemed to point to the multitude of coming slaughters, to the conquest of Italy and of the Romans themselves, to the capture of the city, and to constitutional change.

84 1 This war began as soon as <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> arrived at Brundusium, which was in the 174th Olympiad. Considering the magnitude of the operations, its length was not great, compared with wars of this size in general, since the combatants rushed upon each other with the fury of private enemies. For this special reason greater and more distressing calamities than usual befell those who took part in it in a short space of time, because they rushed to meet their troubles. Nevertheless the war lasted three years in Italy alone, until <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> had secured the supreme power, but in Spain it continued even after <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s death. Battles, skirmishes, sieges, and fighting of all kinds were numerous throughout Italy, and the generals had both regular battles and partial engagements, and all were noteworthy. The greatest and most remarkable of them I shall mention in brief.


X
First of all <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> and <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> fought a battle against <persName n="386">Norbanus</persName> at Canusium and killed 6000 of his men, while <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s loss was seventy, but many of his men were wounded. <persName n="386">Norbanus</persName> retreated to Capua. 85 1 Next, while <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> and <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> were near Teanum, <persName n="307">Lucius Scipio</persName> advanced against them with another army which was very downhearted and longed for peace. The Sullan faction knew this and sent envoys to <persName n="307">Lucius Scipio</persName> to negotiate, not because they hoped or desired to come to an agreement, but because they expected to create dissensions in <persName n="307">Lucius Scipio</persName>'s army, which was in a state of dejection. In this they succeeded. <persName n="307">Lucius Scipio</persName> took hostages for the conference and marched down to the plain. Only three from each side conferred, so that what passed between them is not known. It seems, however, that during the armistice <persName n="307">Lucius Scipio</persName> sent <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> to his colleague, <persName n="386">Norbanus</persName>, to communicate with him concerning the negotiation, and there was a cessation of hostilities while they were waiting for the answers. <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> on his way took possession of Suessa, which had espoused the side of <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, and <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> made complaint of this to <persName n="307">Lucius Scipio</persName>. The latter, either because he was privy to the affair or because he did not know what answer to make concerning the strange act of Quntius <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName>, sent back <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s hostages. His army blamed the consuls for the unjustifiable seizure of Suessa during the armistice and for the surrender of the hostages, who were not demanded back, and made a secret agreement with <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> to go over to him if he would draw nearer. This he did, and straightway they all went over en masse, so that the consul, <persName n="307">Lucius Scipio</persName>, and his son <persName n="308">Lucius Scipio</persName>, alone of the whole army, were left, not knowing what to do, in their tent, where they were captured by <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>. <persName n="307">Lucius Scipio</persName>'s ignorance of a conspiracy of this kind, embracing his whole army, seems to me inexcusable in a general.

86 1 When <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> was unable to induce <persName n="307">Lucius Scipio</persName> to change, he sent him away with his son <persName n="308">Lucius Scipio</persName> unharmed. He also sent other envoys to <persName n="386">Norbanus</persName> at Capua to open negotiations, either because he was apprehensive of the result (since the greater part of Italy still adhered to the consuls), or in order to play the same game on him that he had played on <persName n="307">Lucius Scipio</persName>. As nobody came forward and no away was returned (for it seems that <persName n="386">Norbanus</persName> feared lest he should be accused by his army in the same way that Scipio had been), <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> again advanced, devastating all hostile territory, while <persName n="386">Norbanus</persName> did the same thing on other roads. <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> hastened to the city and caused <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName>, and all the other senators who had joined <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, to be decreed public enemies. It was at this time that the Capitol was burned. Some attributed this deed to <persName n="100">Carbo</persName>, others to the consuls, others to somebody sent by <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>; but of the exact fact there was no evidence, nor am I able now to conjecture what caused the fire. <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName>, who had been some time previously chosen praetor for Spain, after the taking of Suessa fled to his province, and as the former praetor refused to recognize his authority, he stirred up a great deal of trouble for the Romans there. In the meantime the forces of the consuls were constantly increasing from the major part of Italy, which still adhered to them, and also from the neighbouring Gauls on the Po. Nor was <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> idle. He sent messengers to all parts of Italy that he could reach, to collect troops by friendship, by fear, by money, and by promises. In this way the remainder of the summer was consumed on both sides.

87 1 The consuls for the following year were <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> for the second time and <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName>, the son of the great <persName n="602">Marius</persName>, then twenty-seven years of age. At first the winter and severe frost kept the combatants apart. At the beginning of spring, on the banks of the river Aesis, there was a severe engagement lasting from early morning till noon between <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> and <persName n="101">Carinas</persName>, <persName n="100">Carbo</persName>'s lieutenant. <persName n="101">Carinas</persName> was put to flight after heavy loss, whereupon all the country thereabout seceded from the consuls to <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName>. <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> came up with <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> and besieged him until he heard that <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName>, the other consul, had been defeated in a great battle near Praeneste, when he led his forces back to Ariminum, with <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> hung on his rear doing damage. The defeat at Praeneste was in this wise. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> having captured the town of Setia, <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName>, who was encamped near by, drew a little farther away. But when he arrived at the Sacred Lake he gave battle and fought bravely. When his left wing began to give way five cohorts of foot and two of horse decided not to wait for open defeat, but threw away their standards in a body and went over to <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>. This was the beginning of a terrible disaster to <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName>. His shattered army fled to Praeneste with <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> in hot pursuit. The Praenestines gave shelter to those who arrived first, but when <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> pressed upon them the gates were closed, and <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName> was hauled up by ropes. There was another great slaughter round the walls by reason of the closing of the gates. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> captured a large number of prisoners, and killed all the Samnites among them, because they had all along been ill-affected toward the Romans.

88 1 About the same time <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> gained a victory over another army of <persName n="100">Carbo</persName>, and here again five cohorts, for safety's sake, deserted to <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> during the battle. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> overcame <persName n="319">Marcius</persName> near Senae and plundered the town. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, having shut <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName> up in Praeneste, drew a line of circum­vallation round the town a considerable distance from it and left the work in charge of <persName n="392">Ofella</persName>, as he intended to reduce <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName> by famine, not by fighting. When <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName> saw that his condition was hopeless he hastened to put his private enemies out of the way. He wrote to <persName n="82">Brutus</persName>, the city praetor, to call the Senate together on some pretext or other and to kill <persName n="445">Publius Antistius</persName>, the other <persName n="398">Papirius</persName>, <persName n="292">Lucius Domitius</persName>, and <persName n="666">Mucius Scaevola</persName>. Of these the two first were slain in their seats as <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName> had ordered, assassins having been introduced into the senate-house for this purpose. <persName n="292">Lucius Domitius</persName> ran out, but was killed at the door, and <persName n="666">Mucius Scaevola</persName> was killed a little farther away. Their bodies were thrown into the Tiber, for it was now the custom not to bury the slain. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> sent an army to Rome in detachments by different roads with orders to seize the gates, and if they were repulsed to rendezvous at Ostia. The towns on the way received them with fear and trembling, and the city opened its gates to them because the people were oppressed by hunger, and because, of present evils, men always nerve themselves to bear the worse.

89 1 When <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> learned this he came on immediately and established his army before the gates in the Campus Martius. He went inside himself, all of the opposite faction having fled. Their property was at once confiscated and exposed to public sale. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> summoned the people to an assembly, where he lamented the necessity of his present doings and told them to cheer up, as the troubles would soon be over and the government go on as it ought. Having arranged such matters as were pressing and put some of his own men in charge of the city, he set out for Clusium, where the war was still raging. In the meantime a body of Celtiberian horse, sent by the praetors in Spain, had joined the consuls, and there was a cavalry fight on the banks of the river Glanis. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> killed about fifty of the enemy, and then 270 of the Celtiberian horse deserted to him, and <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> himself killed the rest of them, either because he was angry at the desertion of their countrymen or because he feared similar action on their own part. About the same time <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> overcame another detachment of his enemies near Saturnia, and <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> sailed around toward Ravenna and took possession of the level wheat-growing country of Uritanus.29 Another Sullan division effected an entrance into Neapolis by treachery in the night, killed all the inhabitants except a few who had made their escape, and seized the triremes belonging to the city. A severe battle was fought near Clusium between <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> himself and <persName n="100">Carbo</persName>, lasting all day. Neither party had the advantage when darkness put an end to the conflict.

90 1 In the plain of Spoletium, <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and <persName n="133">Crassus</persName>, both <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s officers, killed some 3000 of <persName n="100">Carbo</persName>'s men and besieged <persName n="101">Carinas</persName>, the opposing general. <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> sent reinforcements to <persName n="101">Carinas</persName>, but <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> learned of their movement, laid an ambush for them, and killed about 2000 of them on the road. <persName n="101">Carinas</persName> escaped by night during a heavy rain-storm and thick darkness, since although the besiegers were aware of some movement, they made no opposition on account of the storm. <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> sent <persName n="319">Marcius</persName> with eight legions to the relief of his colleague, <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName>, at Praeneste, having heard that he was suffering from hunger. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> fell upon them from ambush in a defile, defeated them, killed a large number, and surrounded the remainder on a hill. <persName n="319">Marcius</persName> indeed made his escape, leaving his fires burning, but the army blamed him for being caught in an ambush and there was a serious mutiny. One whole legion marched off under their standards to Ariminum without orders. The rest separated and went home in driblets, so that only seven cohorts remained with their general.

<persName n="319">Marcius</persName>, having made a failure of it in this way, returned to <persName n="100">Carbo</persName>. However, <persName n="337">Marcus Lamponius</persName> from Lucania, <persName n="427">Pontius Telesinus</persName> from Samnium, and <persName n="223">Gutta the Capuan</persName>, with 70,000 men, hastened to deliver <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName> from the siege, but <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> occupied a pass which was the only approach to the place, and blocked the road. <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName> now despaired of aid from without, and built a raised fort in the wide space between himself and the enemy, within which he collected his soldiers and his engines, and from which he attempted to force his way through the besieging army of <persName n="392">Ofella</persName>. The attempt was renewed several days in different ways, but he accomplished nothing and was again shut up in Praeneste.

91 1 About the same time <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> and <persName n="386">Norbanus</persName> went by a short road to attack the camp of <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> in Faventia just before nightfall. There was only one hour of daylight left, and there were thick vineyards thereabout. They made their plans for battle with more temper than judgment, hoping to take <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> unawares and to stampede him. But they were beaten, both the place and the time being unfavourable for them. They became entangled in the vines, and suffered a heavy slaughter, losing some 10,000 men. About 6000 more deserted, and the rest were dispersed, only 1000 getting back to Ariminum in good order. Another legion of Lucanians under <persName n="444">Publius Albinovanus</persName>, when they heard of this defeat, went over to <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> to the great chagrin of their leader. As the latter was not able to restrain this impulse of his men, he, for the time, returned to <persName n="386">Norbanus</persName>. Not many days later he sent secretly to <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, and having obtained a promise of safety from him, if he should accomplish anything important, he invited <persName n="386">Norbanus</persName> and his lieutenants, <persName n="177">Gaius Antipater</persName> and <persName n="168">Flavius Fimbria</persName> (brother of the <persName n="167">Fimbria</persName> who committed suicide in Asia), together with such of <persName n="100">Carbo</persName>'s lieutenants as were then present, to a feast. When they had all assembled except <persName n="386">Norbanus</persName> (he was the only one who did not come), <persName n="444">Publius Albinovanus</persName> murdered them all at the banquet and then fled to <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>. <persName n="386">Norbanus</persName>, having learned that, in consequence of this disaster, Ariminum and many other camps in the vicinity were going over to <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, and being unable to rely on the good faith and firm support of many of his friends on the spot, now that he found himself in adversity, took passage on a private ship, and sailed to Rhodes. When, at a later period, <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> demanded his surrender, and while the Rhodians were deliberating on it, he killed himself in the middle of the market-place.

92 1 <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> sent <persName n="141">Damasippus</persName> in haste with two other legions to Praeneste to relieve <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName>, who was still besieged, but not even these could force their way through the pass that was guarded by <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>. The Gauls who inhabited the country lying between Ravenna and the Alps went over to <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> en masse and <persName n="311">Lucullus</persName> won a victory over another body of <persName n="100">Carbo</persName>'s forces near Placentia. When <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> learned these facts, although he still had 30,000 men around Clusium, and the two legions of <persName n="141">Damasippus</persName>, and others under <persName n="101">Carinas</persName> and <persName n="319">Marcius</persName>, besides a large force of Samnites, who were courageously enduring hardships at the pass, he fell into despair and weakly fled to Africa with his friends, although he was still consul, hoping to win over Africa instead of Italy. Of those whom he left behind, the army around Clusium had a battle with <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> in which they lost 20,000 men. Naturally, after this greatest disaster of all, the remainder of the army broke into fragments and each man went to his own home. <persName n="101">Carinas</persName>, <persName n="319">Marcius</persName>, and <persName n="141">Damasippus</persName> went with all the forces they had to the pass in order to force their way through it in conjunction with the Samnites. Failing in the attempt they marched to Rome, thinking that the city might be easily taken, as it was bereft of men and provisions, and they encamped in the Alban territory at a distance of 100 stades from it.

93 1 <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> feared for the safety of the city, and sent his cavalry forward with all speed to hinder their march, and then hastened in person with his whole army and encamped beside the Colline gate near the temple of Venus about noon, the enemy being already encamped around the city. A battle was fought at once, late in the afternoon. On the right wing <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> was victorious, but his left was vanquished and fled to the gates. The old soldiers on the walls, when they saw the enemy rushing in with their own men, dropped the portcullis, which fell upon and killed many soldiers and many senators. But the majority, impelled by fear and necessity, turned and fought the enemy. The fighting continued through the night and a great many were slain. The generals, <persName n="427">Pontius Telesinus</persName> and <persName n="444">Publius Albinovanus</persName>, were slain also and their camp was taken. <persName n="337">Marcus Lamponius</persName> the Lucanian, <persName n="319">Marcius</persName>, and <persName n="101">Carinas</persName>, and the other generals of the faction of <persName n="100">Carbo</persName>, fled. It was estimated that 50,000 men on both sides lost their lives in this engagement. Prisoners, to the number of more than 8,000, were shot down with darts by <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> because they were mostly Samnites. The next day <persName n="319">Marcius</persName> and <persName n="101">Carinas</persName> were captured and brought in. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> did not spare them because they were Romans, but killed them both and sent their heads to <persName n="392">Ofella</persName> at Praeneste to be displayed round the walls.

94 1 When the Praenestians saw them and knew that <persName n="100">Carbo</persName>'s army was completely destroyed, and that <persName n="386">Norbanus</persName> himself had fled from Italy, and that Rome and all the rest of Italy were entirely in the power of <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, they surrendered their city to <persName n="392">Ofella</persName>. <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName> hid himself in an underground tunnel and shortly afterward committed suicide. <persName n="392">Ofella</persName> cut off his head and sent it to <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, who exposed it in the forum in front of the rostra. It is said that he indulged in a jest at the youth of the consul, saying "First learn to row, before you try to steer."30 When <persName n="392">Ofella</persName> took Praeneste he seized the senators who had held commands under <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName>, and put some of them to death and cast the others into prison. The latter were put to death by <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> when he came that way. All the others who were taken in Praeneste he ordered to march out to the plain without arms, and when they had done so he chose out a very few who had been in any way serviceable to him. The remainder he ordered to be divided into three sections, consisting of Romans, Samnites, and Praenestians respectively. When this had been done he announced to the Romans by herald that they had merited death, but nevertheless he would pardon them. The others he shot down to the last man, but their wives and children he allowed to go unharmed. The town, which was extremely rich at that time, he gave over to plunder.

In this way was Praeneste taken. Norba, another town, still resisted with all its might until <persName n="6">Aemilius Lepidus</persName> was admitted to it in the night by treachery. The inhabitants, maddened by this treason, killed themselves, or fell on each other's swords, or strangled themselves with ropes. Others closed the gates and set fire to the town. A strong wind fanned the flames, which so far consumed the place that no plunder was gained from it.



XI
95 1 So perished the stout-hearted men of Norba; and now, after thus crushing Italy by war, fire, and murder, <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s generals visited the several cities and established garrisons at the suspected places. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> was despatched to Africa against <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> and to Sicily against <persName n="100">Carbo</persName>'s friends who had taken refuge there. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> himself called the Roman people together in an assembly and made them a speech, vaunting his own exploits and making other menacing statements in order to inspire terror. He finished by saying that he would bring about a change which would be beneficial to the people if they would obey him, but of his enemies he would spare none, but would visit them with the utmost severity. He would take vengeance by strong measures on the praetors, quaestors, military tribunes, and everybody else who had committed any hostile act after the day when the consul <persName n="307">Lucius Scipio</persName> violated the agreement made with him. After saying this he forthwith proscribed about forty senators and 1600 knights. He seems to have been the first to make a formal list31 of those whom he punished, to offer prizes to assassins and rewards to informers, and to threaten with punishment those who should conceal the proscribed. Shortly afterward he added the names other senators to the proscription. Some of these, taken unawares, were killed wherever they were caught, in their houses, in the streets, or in the temples. Others were hurled through mid-air32 and thrown at <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s feet. Others were dragged through the city and trampled on, none of the spectators daring to utter a word of remonstrance against these horrors. Banishment was inflicted upon some and confiscation upon others. Spies were searching everywhere for those who had fled from the city, and those whom they caught they killed.

96 1 There was much massacre, banishment, and confiscation also among those Italians who had obeyed <persName n="100">Carbo</persName>, or <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName>, or <persName n="386">Norbanus</persName>, or their lieutenants. Severe judgments of the courts were rendered against them throughout all Italy on various charges — for exercising military command, for serving in the army, for contributing money, for rendering other service, or even giving counsel against <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>. Hospitality, private friendship, the borrowing or lending of money, were alike accounted crimes. Now and then one would be arrested for doing a kindness to a suspect, or merely for being his companion on a journey. These accusations abounded mostly against the rich. When charges against individuals failed <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> took vengeance on whole communities. He punished some of them by demolishing their citadels, or destroying their walls, or by imposing fines and crushing them by heavy contributions. Among most of them he placed colonies of his troops in order to hold Italy under garrisons, sequestrating their lands and houses and dividing them among his soldiers, whom he thus made true to him even after his death. As they could not be secure in their own holdings unless all <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s system were on a firm foundation, they were his stoutest champions even after he died.

While the affairs of Italy were in this state, <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> sent a force and captured <persName n="100">Carbo</persName>, who had fled with many persons of distinction from Africa to Sicily and thence to the island of Cossyra. He ordered his officers to kill anyone of the others without bringing them into his presence; but <persName n="100">Carbo</persName>, "the three times consul," he caused to be brought before his feet in chains, and after making a public harangue at him, murdered him and sent his head to <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>.

97 1 When everything had been accomplished against his enemies as he desired, and there was no longer any hostile force except that of <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName>, who was far distant, <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> sent <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> into Spain against him and seized upon everything in the city to suit himself. There was no longer any occasion for laws, or elections, or for casting lots, because everybody was shivering with fear and in hiding, or dumb. Everything that <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> had done as consul, or as proconsul, was confirmed and ratified, and his gilded equestrian statue was erected in front of the rostra with the inscription, "<persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, the ever Fortunate," for so his flatterers called him on account of his unbroken success against his enemies. And this flattering title still attaches to him. I have come across a document which relates that <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> was styled <persName n="155">Epaphroditus</persName> by a decree of the Senate itself. This does not seem to me to be inappropriate for one of his names was xxxxx (lucky), which name seems to have very nearly the same signification as <persName n="155">Epaphroditus</persName>. There was also an oracle given to him somewhere which, in response to his question concerning the future, assured his prosperous career as follows:—

"Roman, believe me! On Aeneas' line

Cypris, its patron, sheddeth power divine;

To all the Immortals bring thy yearly gifts;

And chief to Delphi. But where <persName n="553">Taurus</persName> lifts

His snowy side, and Carian men have walled

A far-spread town, from Aphrodite called,34

There bring an Axe, and power supreme is thine!

Whichever inscription the Romans voted when they erected the statue, they seem to me to have inscribed it either by way of jest or cajolery. However, <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> did actually send a golden crown and axe to Venus with this inscription:—

This Axe to Aphrodite <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> brought,

For in a dream he saw her as she fought

Queen of his host, full armed, and deeds of knighthood wrought.

98 1 Thus <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> became king, or tyrant, de facto, not elected, but holding power by force and violence. As, however, he needed the pretence of being elected this too was managed in this way. The kings of the Romans in the olden time were chosen for their bravery, and whenever one of them died the senators held the royal power in succession for five days each, until the people should decide who should be the new king. This five-day ruler was called the Interrex, which means king for the time being. The retiring consuls always presided over the election of their successors in office, and if there chanced to be no consul at such a time an Interrex was appointed for the purpose of holding the consular comitia. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> took advantage of this custom. There were no consuls at this time, <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> having lost his life in Sicily and <persName n="602">Marius</persName> in Praeneste. So <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> went out of the city for a time and ordered the Senate to choose an Interrex.

They chose <persName n="584">Valerius Flaccus</persName>, expecting that he would soon hold the consular comitia. But <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> wrote ordering <persName n="584">Valerius Flaccus</persName> to represent to the people his own strong opinion that it was to the immediate interest of the city to revive the dictatorship, an office which had now been in abeyance 400 years. He told them not to appoint the dictator for a fixed period, but until such time as he should firmly re-establish the city and Italy and the government generally, shattered as it was by factions and wars. That this proposal referred to himself was not at all doubtful, and <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> made no concealment of it, declaring openly at the conclusion of the letter that, in his judgment, he could be most serviceable to the city in that capacity.

99 1 Such was <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s message. The Romans did not like it, but they had no more opportunities for elections according to law, and they considered that this matter was not altogether in their own power. So, in the general deadlock, they welcomed this pretence of an election as an image and semblance of freedom, and chose <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> as their absolute master for as long a time as he pleased. There had been autocratic rule of the dictators before, but it was limited to short periods. But under <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> it first became unlimited and so an absolute tyranny. All the same they added, for propriety's sake, that they chose him dictator for the enactment of such laws as he himself might deem best and for the regulation of the commonwealth. Thus the Romans, after having government by kings for above sixty Olympiads, and a democracy, under consuls chosen yearly, for 100 Olympiads, resorted to kingly government again. This was in the 175th Olympiad, according to the Greek calendar, but there were no Olympic games then except races in the stadium, since <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> had carried away the athletes and all the sights and shows to Rome to celebrate his victories in the Mithridatic and Italian wars, under the pretext that the masses needed a breathing-spell and recreation after their toils.

100 1 Nevertheless, by way of keeping up the form of the republic he allowed them to appoint consuls. <persName n="346">Marcus Tullius</persName> and <persName n="124">Cornelius Dolabella</persName> were chosen. But <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, like a reigning sovereign, was dictator over the consuls. Twenty-four axes were borne in front of him as dictator, the same number that were borne before the ancient kings, and he had a large body-guard also. He repealed laws and enacted others. He forbade anybody to hold the office of praetor until after he had held that of quaestor, or to be consul before he had been praetor, and he prohibited any man from holding the same office a second time till after the lapse of ten years. He reduced the tribunician power to such an extent that it seemed to be destroyed. He curtailed it by a law which provided that one holding the office of tribune should never afterward hold any other office; for which reason all men of reputation or family, who formerly contended for this office, shunned it thereafter. I am not able to say positively whether <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> transferred this office from the people to the Senate, where it is now lodged, or not. To the Senate itself, which had been much thinned by the seditions and wars, he added about 300 members from the best of the knights, taking the vote of the tribes on each one. To the plebeians he added more than 10,000 slaves of proscribed persons, choosing the youngest and strongest, to whom he gave freedom and Roman citizenship, and he called them Cornelii after himself. In this way he made sure of having 10,000 men among the plebeians always ready to obey his commands. In order to provide the same kind of safeguard throughout Italy he distributed to the twenty-three legions that had served under him a great deal of land in the various communities, as I have already related, some of which was public property and some taken from the communities by way of fine.

101 1 So terrible in all ways was he and so uncontrollable in anger that finding it vain to check and hinder by persuasive means <persName n="392">Ofella</persName>, who had besieged and captured Praeneste together with the consul <persName n="196">Gaius Marius</persName>, and had won the final victory for him, and who was now, despite the new law, presumed to be a candidate for the consulship while still in the equestrian order and before he had been quaestor and praetor, counting on the greatness of his services, according to the traditional custom, and appealing to the populace, he slew him in the middle of the forum. Then <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> assembled the people and said to them "Know, citizens, and learn from me, that I put to death <persName n="392">Ofella</persName> because he disobeyed me." And then he told a parable: "A husbandman was bitten by fleas while ploughing. He stopped his ploughing twice in order to shake them out of his shirt. When they bit him again he burned his shirt, to avoid interruption in his work. And I tell you, who have felt my hand twice, to take warning lest the third time you need fire." With these words he terrified them and thereafter ruled as he pleased. He had a triumph on account of the Mithridatic war, during which some of the scoffers called his government "the official denial of royalty" because he kept back only the name of king. Others took the contrary view, judging from his acts, and called it "the official avowal of tyranny."

102 1 Into such evils were the Romans and all the Italians plunged by this war; and so likewise were all the countries beyond Italy by the recent piracies, or by the Mithridatic war, or by the many exhausting taxes levied to meet the deficit in the public treasury due to the seditions. All the allied nations and kings, and not only the tributary cities, but those which had delivered themselves to the Romans voluntarily under sworn agreements, and those which by virtue of their furnishing aid in war or for some other merit were autonomous and not subject to tribute, all were now required to pay and to obey, while some were deprived of the territory and harbours that had been conceded to them under treaties.

<persName n="549">Sulla</persName> declared that <persName n="12">Alexander</persName> (the son of <persName n="13">Alexander</persName>, the former soverign of Egypt), who had been reared in Cos and given up to <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName> by the inhabitants of that island, and had fled to <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> and become intimate with him, should be king of Alexandria. He did this because the governor of Alexandria was destitute of a sovereign in the male line, and the women of the royal house wanted a man of the same lineage, and because he expected to reap a large reward from a rich kingdom. As, however, <persName n="12">Alexander</persName> relying upon <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> behaved himself in a very offensive manner toward them, the Alexandrians, on the nineteenth day of his reign, dragged him from the palace to the gymnasium and put him to death; for they too were still without fear of foreigners, either by reason of the magnitude of their own government or their inexperience as yet of external dangers.


XII
103 1 The following year <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, although he was dictator, undertook the consulship a second time, with <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> for his colleague, in order to preserve the pretence and form of democratic government. It is perhaps from this example that the Roman emperors appoint consuls for the country and even sometimes nominate themselves, considering it not unbecoming to hold the office of consul in connection with the supreme power.

The next year the people, in order to pay court to <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, chose him consul again, but he refused the office and nominated <persName n="524">Servilius Isauricus</persName> and <persName n="113">Claudius Pulcher</persName>, and voluntarily laid down the supreme power, although nobody interfered with him. This act seems wonderful to me — that <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> should have been the first, and till then the only one, to abdicate such vast power without compulsion, not to sons (like <persName n="436">Ptolemy I</persName> in Egypt, or <persName n="45">Ariobarzanes I</persName> in Cappadocia, or <persName n="513">Seleucus I</persName> in Syria), but to the very people over whom he had tyrannized. Almost incredible is it that after incurring so many dangers in forcing his way to this power he should have laid it down of his own free will after he had acquired it. Paradoxical beyond anything is the fact that he was afraid of nothing, although more than 100,000 young men had perished in this war, and he had destroyed of his enemies 90 senators, 15 consulars, and 2600 knights, including the banished. The property of these men had been confiscated and the bodies of many cast out unburied. Undaunted by the relatives of these persons at home, or by the banished abroad, or by the cities whose towers and walls he had thrown down and whose lands, money, and privileges he had swept away, <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> now proclaimed himself a citizen.

104 1 So great was this man's boldness and good fortune. It is said that he made a speech in the forum when he laid down his power in which he offered to give the reasons for what he had done to anybody who should ask them. He dismissed the lictors with their axes and discontinued his body-guard, and for a long time walked to the forum with only a few friends, the multitude looking upon him with awe even then. Once only when he was going home he was reviled by a boy. As nobody restrained this boy he made bold to follow <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> to his house, railing at him; and <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, who had opposed the greatest men and states with towering rage, endured his reproaches with calmness, and as he went into the house said, divining the future either by his intelligence or by chance, "This young man will prevent any future holder of such power from laying it down."

This saying was shortly confirmed to the Romans, for <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> never laid down his power, but <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> seems to me, having shewn himself the same masterful and able man in all respects, to have desired to reach supreme power from private life, and to change back to private life from supreme power, and then to pass his time in rural solitude; for he retired to his own estate at Cumae in Italy and there occupied his leisure in hunting and fishing. He did this not because he was afraid to live a private life in the city, nor because he had not sufficient bodily strength for whatever he might be eager to do, for he was still of virile age and sound constitution, and there were 120,000 men throughout Italy who had recently served under him in war and had received large gifts of money and land from him, and there were the 10,000 Cornelii ready in the city, besides other people of his party devoted to him and still formidable to his opponents, all of whom rested upon <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s safety their hopes of impunity for what they had done in co-operation with him. But I think that because he was weary of war, weary of power, weary of Rome, he finally fell in love with rural life.

105 1 Directly after his retirement the Romans, although delivered from slaughter and tyranny, began gradually to feed the flames of new seditions. <persName n="465">Quintus Catulus</persName> and <persName n="6">Aemilius Lepidus</persName> were chosen consuls, the former of the Sullan faction and the latter of the opposite party. They hated each other bitterly and began to quarrel immediately, from which it was plain that fresh troubles were imminent.

While he was living in the country <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> had a dream in which he thought he saw his Genius already calling him. Early in the morning he told the dream to his friends and in haste began writing his will, which he finished that day. After sealing it he was taken with a fever towards evening and died the same night. He was sixty years of age and was, I think, as his name suggests, the "most fortunate" of men in life and in death itself; that is, if the fortunate man is he who obtains all that he desires. Immediately a dissensions sprang up in the city over his remains, some proposing to bring them in a procession through Italy and exhibit them in the forum and give him a public funeral. <persName n="6">Aemilius Lepidus</persName> and his faction opposed this, but <persName n="465">Quintus Catulus</persName> and the Sullan party prevailed. <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s body was borne through Italy on a golden litter with royal splendour. Trumpeters and horsemen in great numbers went in advance and a great multitude of armed men followed on foot. His soldiers flocked from all directions under arms to join the procession, and each one was assigned his place in due order as he came, while the crowd of common people that came together was unprecedented, and in front of all were borne the standards and the fasces that he had used while living and ruling.

106 1 When the remains reached the city then indeed they were borne through the streets with an enormous procession. More than 2000 golden crowns which had been made in haste were carried in it, the gifts of cities and of the legions that he had commanded and of individual friends. It would be impossible to describe all the costly things contributed to this funeral. From fear of the assembled soldiery all the priests and priestesses escorted the remains, each in proper costume. The entire Senate and the whole body of magistrates attended with their insignia of office. A multitude of knights followed with their peculiar decorations, and, in their turn, all the legions that had fought under him. They came together with eagerness, all hastening to join in the task, carrying gilded standards and silver-plated shields, such as are still used on such occasions. There was a countless number of trumpeters who in turns played the most melting and dirge-like strains. Loud cries of farewell were raised, first by the Senate, then by the knights, then by the soldiers, and finally by the plebeians. For some really longed for <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, but others were afraid of his army and his dead body, as they had been of himself when living. As they looked at the present spectacle and remembered what this man had accomplished they were amazed, and agreed with their opponents that he had been most fortunate for his own party and most formidable to themselves even in death. The body was shown in the forum on the rostra, where public speeches are usually made, and the most eloquent of the Romans then living delivered the funeral oration, as <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s son, <persName n="163">Faustus</persName>, was still very young. Then strong men of the senators took up the bier and carried it to Campus Martius, where only kings were buried, and the knights and the army marched past the funeral fire.



XIII
107 1 This was <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s end, but directly after their return from the funeral the consuls fell into a wordy quarrel and the citizens began to take sides with them. <persName n="6">Aemilius Lepidus</persName>, in order to curry favour with the Italians, said that he would restore the land which <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> had taken from them. The Senate was afraid of both factions and made them take an oath that they would not carry their differences to the point of war. To <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> the province of transalpine Gaul was assigned by lot, and he did not come back to the comitia because he realised he would be released in the following year from his oath not to make war on the Sullans; for it was considered that the oath was binding only during the term of office. As his designs did not escape observation he was recalled by the Senate, and as he knew why he was recalled he came with his whole army, intending to bring them into the city with him. As he was prevented from doing this, he ordered his men under arms, and <persName n="465">Quintus Catulus</persName> did the same thing on the other side. A battle was fought not far from the Campus Martius. <persName n="6">Aemilius Lepidus</persName> was defeated, and, soon giving up the struggle, sailed shortly afterwards to Sardinia, where he died of a wasting disease. His army was frittered away little by little and dissolved; the greater part of it was conducted by <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName> to <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> in Spain.

108 1 There remained of the Sullan troubles the war with <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName>, which had been going on for eight years, and was not an easy war to the Romans since it was waged not merely against Spaniards, but against other Romans and <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName>. He had been chosen governor of Spain while he was co-operating with <persName n="100">Carbo</persName> against <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>; and after taking the city of Suessa during the armistice he fled and assumed his governorship. He had an army from Italy itself and he raised another from the Celtiberians, and drove out of Spain the former praetors, who, in order to favour <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, refused to surrender the government to him. He had also fought nobly against <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName>, who had been sent against him by <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>. Having acquired a reputation for bravery he enrolled a council of 300 members from the friends who were with him, and called it the Roman Senate in derision of the real one. After <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> died, and <persName n="6">Aemilius Lepidus</persName> later, he obtained another army of Italians which <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName>, the lieutenant of <persName n="6">Aemilius Lepidus</persName>, brought to him and it was supposed he intended to march against Italy itself, and would have done so had not the Senate become alarmed and sent another army and general into Spain in addition to the former ones. This general was <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, who was still a young man, but renowned for his exploits in the time of <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, in Africa and Italy itself.

109 1 <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> courageously crossed the alps, not with the expenditure of labour of <persName n="225">Hannibal</persName>, but by opening another passage around the sources of the Rhone and the Eridanus. These issue from the Alpine mountains not far from each other. One of them runs through Transalpine Gaul and empties into the Tyrrhenian sea; the other from the interior of the Alps to the Adriatic, its name having been changed from the Eridanus to the Po. Directly <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> arrived in Spain <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> cut in pieces a whole legion of his army, which had been sent out foraging, together with its animals and servants. He also plundered and destroyed the Roman town of Lauro before the very eyes of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. In this siege a woman tore out with her fingers the eyes of a soldier who had insulted her and was trying to commit an outrage upon her. When Qunitus <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> heard of this he put to death the whole cohort that was supposed to be addicted to such brutality, although it was composed of Romans. 110 1 Then the armies were separated by the advent of winter.

When spring came they resumed hostilities, <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> and <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> coming from the Pyrenees, where they had wintered, and <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> and <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName> from Lusitania. They met near the town of Sucro. While the fight was going on flashes of lightning came unexpectedly from a clear sky, but these trained soldiers stood it all without being in the least dismayed. They continued the fight, with heavy slaughter on both sides, until <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> defeated <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName> and plundered his camp. On the other hand, Quitnus <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> defeated <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, who received a dangerous wound from a spear in the thigh, and this put an end to that battle.

<persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> had a white fawn that was tame and allowed to move about freely. When this fawn was not in sight <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> considered it a bad omen. He became low-spirited and abstained from fighting; nor did he mind the enemy's scoffing at him about the fawn. When she made her appearance running through the woods <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> would run to meet her, and, as though he were consecrating the first-fruits of a sacrifice to her, he would at once direct a hail of javelins at the enemy.

Not long afterward <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> fought a great battle near Seguntia, lasting from noon till night. Qutinus <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> fought on horseback and vanquished <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, killing nearly 6000 of his men and losing about half that number himself. <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> at the same time destroyed about 5000 of <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName>'s army. The day after this battle <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName>, with a large reinforcement of barbarians, attacked the camp of <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> unexpectedly towards evening with the intention of boldly cutting it off with a trench, but <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> hastened up and caused <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> to desist from his contemptuous enterprise.

In this way they passed the summer, and again they separated to winter quarters. 111 1 The following year, which was in the 176th Olympiad, two countries were acquired by the Romans by bequest. Bithynia was left to them by <persName n="383">Nicomedes</persName>, and Cyrene by <persName n="435">Ptolemy Apion</persName> surnamed Apion, of the house of the Lagidae. There were wars and wars; the Sertorian was raging in Spain, the Mithridatic in the East, that of the pirates on the entire sea, and another around Crete against the Cretans themselves, besides the gladiatorial war in Italy, which started suddenly and became very serious. Although distracted by so many conflicts the Romans sent another army of two legions into Spain. With these and the other forces in their hands <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> and <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> again descended from the Pyrenees to the Ebro; and <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> and <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName> advanced from Lusitania to meet them.

112 1 At this juncture many of the soldiers of <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> deserted to <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName>, at which <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> was so exasperated that he visited savage and barbarous punishment upon many of his men and became unpopular in consequence. The soldiers blamed him particularly because wherever he went he surrounded himself with a body-guard of Celtiberian spearmen instead of Romans, and gave the care of his person to the former in place of the latter. Nor could they bear to be reproached with treachery by him while they were serving under an enemy of the Roman people. That they should be charged with bad faith by <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> while they were acting in bad faith to their country on his account was the very thing that vexed them most. Nor did they consider it just that those who remained with the standards should be condemned because others deserted. Moreover, the Celtiberians took this occasion to insult them as men under suspicion. Still they did not wholly break with <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> since they derived advantages from his service, for there was no other man of that period more skilled in the art of war or more successful in it. For this reason, and on account of the rapidity of his movements, the Celtiberians gave <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> the name of <persName n="225">Hannibal</persName>, whom they considered the boldest and most crafty general ever known in their country. In this way the army stood affected toward <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName>, and on this account the forces of <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> overran many of his towns and brought the men belonging to them under subjection. While <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> was laying siege to Palantia and slinging logs of wood along the foot of the walls <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> suddenly appeared on the scene and raised the siege. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> hastily set fire to the walls and retreated to <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName>. <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> rebuilt the part of the wall which had fallen and then attacked his enemies who were encamped around the castle of Calagurris and killed 3000 of them. And so this year went by in Spain.

113 1 In the following year the Roman generals plucked up rather more courage and advanced in an audacious manner against the towns that adhered to <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName>, drew many away from him, assaulted others, and were much elated by their success. No great battle was fought, but skirmishes continued until the following year, when they advanced again even more audaciously. Quitnus <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> was now evidently smitten by some heaven-sent madness, for he relaxed his labours, fell into habits of luxury, and gave himself up to women, carousing and drinking, and as a result was defeated continually. He became hot-tempered, from various suspicions and, extremely cruel in punishment, and distrustful of everybody, so much so that <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName>, who had belonged to the faction of <persName n="6">Aemilius Lepidus</persName> and had come to him as a volunteer with a considerable army, began to fear for his own safety and formed a conspiracy with ten other men against him. The conspiracy was betrayed, some of the guilty ones were punished and others fled, but <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName> escaped detection in some unaccountable manner and applied himself all the more to carry out the design. As <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> was never without his guard of spearmen, <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName> invited him to a banquet, plied him and the guards who surrounded the banqueting room with wine, and assassinated him after the feast.

114 1 The soldiers straightway rose in tumult and anger against <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName>, their hatred of <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> being suddenly turned to affection for him, as people generally mollify their anger toward the dead, and when he who has injured them is no longer before their eyes recall his virtues with tender memory. Reflecting on their present situation they despised <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName> too as a private individual, for they considered that the bravery of <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> had been their only salvation. They were angry with <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName>, and the barbarians were no less so; and above all the Lusitanians, of whose services <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> had especially availed himself.

When the will of <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> was opened a bequest to <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName> was found in it, and thereupon still greater anger and hatred of him entered into the minds of all, since he had committed such an abominable crime, nor merely against his ruler and commanding general, but against his friend and benefactor. And they would not have abstained from violence had not <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName> bestirred himself, making gifts to some and promises to others. Some he terrified with threats and some he killed in order to strike terror into the rest. He came forward and made a speech to the multitude, and released from confinement some whom <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> had imprisoned, and dismissed some of the Spanish hostages. Reduced in this way to submission they obeyed him as general (for he held the next rank to <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName>), yet they were not without bitterness toward him even then. As he grew bolder he became very cruel in punishments, and put to death three of the nobility who had fled together from Rome to him, and also his own nephew.

115 1 As <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> had gone to other parts of Spain — for he considered it no longer a difficult task for <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> alone to vanquish <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName> — these two skirmished and made tests of each other for several days, but did not bring their whole strength into the field. On the tenth day, however, a great battle was fought between them. They resolved to decide the contest by one engagement — <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> because he despised the generalship of <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName>; <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName> because he did not believe that his army would long remain faithful to him, and he was now engaging with nearly his maximum strength. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, as might have been expected, soon got the better of this inferior general and disaffected army. <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName> was defeated all along the line and concealed himself in a thicket, more fearful of his own troops than of the enemy's. He was seized by some horsemen and dragged towards <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s headquarters, loaded with the execrations of his own men, as the murderer of Quitnus <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName>, and crying out that he would give <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> information about the factions in Rome. This he said either because it was true, or in order to be brought safe to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s presence, but the latter sent orders and put him to death before he came into his presence, fearing, it seemed, lest some startling revelation might be the source of new troubles at Rome. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> seems to have behaved very prudently in this matter, and his action added to his high reputation. So ended the war in Spain with the life of <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName>. I think that if he had lived longer the war would not have ended so soon or so easily.


XIV
116 1 At the same time <persName n="542">Spartacus</persName>, a Thracian by birth, who had once served as a soldier with the Romans, but had since been a prisoner and sold for a gladiator, and was in the gladiatorial training-school at Capua, persuaded about seventy of his comrades to strike for their own freedom rather than for the amusement of spectators. They overcame the guards and ran away, arming themselves with clubs and daggers that they took from people on the roads, and took refuge on Mount Vesuvius. There many fugitive slaves and even some freemen from the fields joined <persName n="542">Spartacus</persName>, and he plundered the neighbouring country, having for subordinate officers two gladiators named <persName n="391">Oenomaus</persName> and <persName n="136">Crixus</persName>. As he divided the plunder impartially he soon had plenty of men. <persName n="586">Varinius</persName> was first sent against him and afterwards <persName n="457">Publius Valerius</persName>, not with regular armies, but with forces picked up in haste and at random, for the Romans did not consider this a war yet, but a raid, something like an attack of robbery. They attacked <persName n="542">Spartacus</persName> and were beaten. <persName n="542">Spartacus</persName> even captured the horse of <persName n="586">Varinius</persName>; so narrowly did the very general of the Romans escape being captured by a gladiator.

After this still greater numbers flocked to <persName n="542">Spartacus</persName> till his army numbered 70,000. For these he manufactured weapons and collected equipment, whereas Rome now sent out the consuls with two legions. 117 1 One of them overcame <persName n="136">Crixus</persName> with 30,000 men near Mount Garganus, two-thirds of whom perished together with himself. <persName n="542">Spartacus</persName> endeavoured to make his way through the Apennines to the Alps and the Gallic country, but one of the consuls anticipated him and hindered his flight while the other hung upon his rear. He turned upon them one after the other and beat them in detail. They retreated in confusion in different directions. <persName n="542">Spartacus</persName> sacrificed 300 Roman prisoners to the shade of <persName n="136">Crixus</persName>, and marched on Rome with 120,000 foot, having burned all his useless material, killed all his prisoners, and butchered his pack-animals in order to expedite his movement. Many deserters offered themselves to him, but he would not accept them. The consuls again met him in the country of Picenum. Here there was fought another great battle and there was, too, another great defeat for the Romans.

<persName n="542">Spartacus</persName> changed his intention of marching on Rome. He did not consider himself ready as yet for that kind of a fight, as his whole force was not suitably armed, for no city had joined him, but only slaves, deserters, and riff-raff. However, he occupied the mountains around Thurii and took the city itself. He prohibited the bringing in of gold or silver by merchants, and would not allow his own men to acquire any, but he bought largely of iron and brass and did not interfere with those who dealt in these articles. Supplied with abundant material from this source his men provided themselves with plenty of arms and made frequent forays for the time being. When they next came to an engagement with the Romans they were again victorious, and returned laden with spoils.

118 1 this war, so formidable to the Romans (although ridiculed and despised in the beginning, as being merely the work of gladiators), had now lasted three years. When the election of new praetors came on, fear fell upon all, and nobody offered himself as a candidate until <persName n="133">Crassus</persName>, a man distinguished among the Romans for birth and wealth, assumed the praetorship and marched against <persName n="542">Spartacus</persName> with six new legions. When he arrived at his destination he received also the two legions of the consuls, whom he decimated by lot for their bad conduct in several battles. Some say that <persName n="133">Crassus</persName>, too, having engaged in battle with his whole army, and having been defeated, decimated the whole army and was not deterred by their numbers, but destroyed about 4000 of them. Whichever way it was, when he had once demonstrated to them that he was more dangerous to them than the enemy, he overcame immediately 10,000 of the Spartacans, who were encamped somewhere in a detached position, and killed two-thirds of them. He then marched boldly against <persName n="542">Spartacus</persName> himself, vanquished him in a brilliant engagement, and pursued his fleeing forces to the sea, where they tried to pass over to Sicily. He overtook them and enclosed them with a line of circum­vallation consisting of ditch, wall, and paling.

119 1 <persName n="542">Spartacus</persName> tried to break through and make an incursion into the Samnite country, but <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> slew about 6000 of his men in the morning and as many more towards evening. Only three of the Roman army were killed and seven wounded, so great was the improvement in their moral inspired by the recent punishment. <persName n="542">Spartacus</persName>, who was expecting a reinforcement of horse from somewhere, no longer went into battle with his whole army, but harassed the besiegers by frequent sallies here and there. He fell upon them unexpectedly and continually, threw bundles of fagots into the ditch and set them on fire and made their labour difficult. He also crucified a Roman prisoner in the space between the two armies to show his own men what fate awaited them if they did not conquer. But when the Romans in the city heard of the siege they thought it would be disgraceful if this war against gladiators should be prolonged. Believing also that the work still to be done against <persName n="542">Spartacus</persName> was great and severe they ordered up the army of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, which had just arrived from Spain, as a reinforcement.

120 1 On account of this vote <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> tried in every way to come to an engagement with <persName n="542">Spartacus</persName> so that <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> might not reap the glory of the war. <persName n="542">Spartacus</persName> himself, thinking to anticipate <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, invited <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> to come to terms with him. When his proposals were rejected with scorn he resolved to risk a battle, and as his cavalry had arrived he made a dash with his whole army through the lines of the besieging force and pushed on to Brundusium with <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> in pursuit. When <persName n="542">Spartacus</persName> learned that <persName n="311">Lucullus</persName> had just arrived in Brundusium from his victory over <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName> he despaired of everything and brought his forces, which were even then very numerous, to close quarters with <persName n="133">Crassus</persName>. The battle was long and bloody, as might have been expected with so many thousands of desperate men. <persName n="542">Spartacus</persName> was wounded in the thigh with a spear and sank upon his knee, holding his shield in front of him and contending in this way against his assailants until he and the great mass of those with him were surrounded and slain. The Roman loss was about 1000. The body of <persName n="542">Spartacus</persName> was not found. A large number of his men fled from the battle-field to the mountains and <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> followed them thither. They divided themselves in four parts, and continued to fight until they all perished except 6000, who were captured and crucified along the whole road from Capua to Rome.

121 1 <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> accomplished his task within six months, whence arose a contention for honours between himself and <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> did not dismiss his army, for <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> did not dismiss his. Both were candidates for the consulship. <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> had been praetor as the law of <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> required. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> had been neither praetor nor quaestor, and was only thirty-four years old, but he had promised the tribunes of the people that much of their former power should be restored. When they were chosen consuls they did not even then dismiss their armies, which were stationed near the city. Each one offered an excuse. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> said that he was waiting the return of <persName n="362">Metellus Pius</persName> for his Spanish triumph; <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> said that <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> ought to dismiss his army first.

The people, seeing fresh seditions brewing and fearing two armies encamped round about, besought the consuls, while they were occupying the curule chairs in the forum, to be reconciled to each other; but at first both of them repelled these solicitations. When, however, certain persons, who seemed prophetically inspired, predicted many direful consequences if the consuls did not come to an agreement, the people again implored them with lamentations and the greatest dejection, reminding them of the evils produced by the contentions of <persName n="602">Marius</persName> and <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>. <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> yielded first. He came down from his chair, advanced to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, and offered him his hand in the way of reconciliation. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> rose and hastened to meet him. They shook hands amid general acclamations and the people did not leave the assembly until the consuls had given orders in writing to disband their armies. Thus was the well-grounded fear of another great dissension happily dispelled. This was about the sixtieth year in the course of the civil convulsions, reckoning from the death of <persName n="564">Tiberius Gracchus</persName>.

Book II

1 1 After the sole rule of <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, and the operations, later on, of <persName n="519">Sertorius</persName> and <persName n="403">Perpenna</persName> in Spain, other internal commotions of a similar nature took place among the Romans until <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> waged war against each other, and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> made an end of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and was himself killed in the senate-chamber because he was accused of behaving after the fashion of royalty. How these things came about and how both <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> lost their lives, this second book of the Civil Wars will show.

<persName n="423">Pompey</persName> had lately cleared the sea of pirates, who were then more numerous than ever before, and afterwards had overthrown <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName>, king of Pontus, and regulated his kingdom and the other nations that he had subdued in the East. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was still a young man, but powerful in speech and action, audacious in every way, sanguine in everything, and profuse beyond his means in the pursuit of honours. While yet aedile and praetor he had incurred great debts and had made himself wonderfully agreeable to the multitude, who always sing the praises of those who are lavish in expenditure.

2 1 <persName n="605">Catiline</persName> was a person of note, by reason of his great celebrity, and high birth, but a madman, for it was believed that he had killed his own son because of his own love for <persName n="67">Aurelia Orestilla</persName>, who was not willing to marry a man who had a son. He had been a friend and zealous partisan of <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>. He had reduced himself to poverty in order to gratify his ambition, but still he was courted by the powerful, both men and women, and he became a candidate for the consulship as a step leading to absolute power. He confidently expected to be elected; but the suspicion of his ulterior designs defeated him, and <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, the most eloquent orator and rhetorician of the period, was chosen instead. <persName n="605">Catiline</persName>, by way of raillery and contempt for those who voted for him, called him a "New Man," on account of his obscure birth (for so they call those who achieve distinction by their own merits and not by those of their ancestors); and because he was not born in the city he called him "The Lodger,"2 by which term they designate those who occupy houses belonging to others. From this time <persName n="605">Catiline</persName> abstained wholly from politics as not leading quickly and surely to absolute power, but as full of the spirit of contention and malice. He procured much money from many women who hoped that they would get their husbands killed in the rising, and he formed a conspiracy with a number of senators and knights, and collected together a body of plebeians, foreign residents, and slaves. His leading fellow-conspirators were <persName n="259">Lentulus</persName> and <persName n="109">Cethegus</persName>, who were then the city praetors. He sent emissaries throughout Italy to those of <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>'s soldiers who had squandered the gains of their former life of plunder and who longed for similar doings. For this purpose he sent <persName n="195">Gaius Manlius</persName> to Faesulae in Etruria and others to Picenum and Apulia, who enlisted soldiers for him secretly.

3 1 All these facts, while they were still secret, were communicated to <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> by <persName n="171">Fulvia</persName>, a woman of quality. Her lover, <persName n="467">Quintus Curius</persName>, who had been expelled from the Senate for many deeds of shame and was thought fit to share in this plot of <persName n="605">Catiline</persName>'s, told his mistress in a vain and boastful way that he would soon be in a position of great power. By now, too, a rumour of what was transpiring in Italy was getting about. Accordingly <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> stationed guards at intervals throughout the city, and sent many of the nobility to the suspected places to watch what was going on. <persName n="605">Catiline</persName>, although nobody had ventured to lay hands on him, because the facts were not yet accurately known, was nevertheless timid lest, with delay, suspicion also should increase. Trusting to rapidity of movement he forwarded money to Faesulae and directed his fellow-conspirators to kill <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> and set the city on fire at a number of different places during the same night. Then he departed to join <persName n="195">Gaius Manlius</persName>, intending to collect additional forces and invade the city while burning. So extremely vain was he that he had the rods and axes borne before him as though he were a proconsul, and he proceeded on his journey to <persName n="195">Manlius</persName>, enlisting soldiers as he went. <persName n="259">Lentulus</persName> and his fellow-conspirators decided that when they should learn that <persName n="605">Catiline</persName> had arrived at Faesulae, <persName n="259">Lentulus</persName> and <persName n="109">Cethegus</persName> should present themselves at <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>'s door early in the morning with concealed daggers, and when their rank gained them admission, enter into conversation with him in the vestibule on some subject, no matter what; draw him away from his own people, and kill him; that <persName n="74">Bestia</persName>, the tribune, should at once call an assembly of the people by heralds and accuse <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> as always timorous, a stirrer up of war and ready to disturb the city without cause; and that on the night following <persName n="74">Bestia</persName>'s speech the city should be set on fire by others in twelve places and looted, and the leading citizens killed.

4 1 Such were the designs of <persName n="259">Lentulus</persName>, <persName n="109">Cethegus</persName>, <persName n="544">Statilius</persName>, and <persName n="286">Lucius Cassius</persName>, the chiefs of the conspiracy, and they waited for their time. Meanwhile ambassadors of the Allobroges, who were making complaint against their magistrates, were solicited to join the conspiracy of <persName n="259">Lentulus</persName> in order to cause an uprising against the Romans in Gaul. <persName n="259">Lentulus</persName> sent in company with them, to <persName n="605">Catiline</persName>, a man of Croton named <persName n="601">Vulturcius</persName>, who carried letters without signatures. The Allobroges being in doubt communicated the matter to <persName n="159">Fabius Sanga</persName>, the patron of their state; for it was the custom of all the subject states to have patrons at Rome. Sanga communicated the facts to <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, who arrested the Allobroges and <persName n="601">Vulturcius</persName> on their journey and brought them straightway before the Senate. They confessed to their understanding with <persName n="259">Lentulus</persName>' agents, and when confronted with them testified that <persName n="259">Lentulus</persName> had often said that it was written in the book of fate that three Cornelii should be monarchs of Rome, two of whom, <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> and <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, had already been such.

5 1 When they had so testified the Senate deprived <persName n="259">Lentulus</persName> of his office. <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> put each of the conspirators under arrest at the houses of the praetors, and returned directly to take the vote of the Senate concerning them. In the meantime there was a great tumult around the senate-house, the affair being as yet little understood, and a good deal of alarm among the conspirators. The slaves and freedmen of <persName n="259">Lentulus</persName> and <persName n="109">Cethegus</persName>, reinforced by numerous artisans, made a circuit by back streets and assaulted the houses of the praetors in order to rescue their masters. When <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> heard of this he hurried out of the senate-house and stationed the necessary guards and then came back and hastened the taking of the vote. <persName n="536">Silanus</persName>, the consul-elect, spoke first, as it was the custom among the Romans for the man who was about to assume that office to deliver his opinion first, because, as I think, he would have most to do with the execution of the decrees, and hence would give more careful consideration and use more circumspection in each case. It was the opinion of <persName n="536">Silanus</persName> that the culprits should suffer the extreme penalty, and many senators agreed with him until it came to Nero's turn to deliver his opinion. Nero judged that it would be best to keep them under guard until <persName n="605">Catiline</persName> should be beaten in the field and they could obtain the most accurate knowledge of the facts.

6 1 <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was not free from the suspicion of complicity with these men, but <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> did not venture to bring into the controversy one so popular with the masses. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> proposed that <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> should distribute the culprits among the towns of Italy, according to his own discretion, to be kept until <persName n="605">Catiline</persName> should be beaten in fight, and that then they should be regularly tried, instead of inflicting an irremediable punishment upon members of the nobility without argument and trial. As this opinion appeared to be just and acceptable, most of the senators changed completely, until <persName n="104">Cato</persName> openly manifested his suspicion of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>; and <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, who had apprehensions concerning the coming night (lest the crowd who were concerned with the conspiracy and were still in the forum in a state of suspense, fearful for themselves and the conspirators, might do something desperate), persuaded the Senate to give judgment against them without trial as persons caught in the act. <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> immediately, while the Senate was still in session, conducted each of the conspirators from the houses where they were in custody to the prison, without the knowledge of the crowd, and saw them put to death. Then he went back to the forum and signified that they were dead. The crowd dispersed in alarm, congratulating themselves that they had not been found out.

Thus the city breathed freely once more after the great fear that had weighed upon it that day, 7 1 but <persName n="605">Catiline</persName> had assembled about 20,000 troops, of whom one-fourth part were already armed, and was moving toward Gaul in order to complete his preparations, when <persName n="26">Antonius Hybrida</persName>, the other consul, overtook him at the foot of the Alps4 and easily defeated the madly-conceived adventure of the man, which was still more madly put to the test without preparation. Neither <persName n="605">Catiline</persName> nor any of the nobility who were associated with him deigned to fly, but all flung themselves upon their enemies and perished.

Such was the end of the rising of <persName n="605">Catiline</persName>, which almost brought the city to the extreme of peril. <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, who had been hitherto distinguished only for eloquence, was now in everybody's mouth as a man of action, and was considered unquestionably the saviour of his country on the eve of its destruction, for which reason the thanks of the assembly were bestowed upon him, amid general acclamations. At the instance of <persName n="104">Cato</persName> the people saluted him as the Father of his country. Some think that this honourable appellation, which is now bestowed upon those emperors who are deemed worthy of it, had its beginning with <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, for although they are in fact kings, it is not given even to them with their other titles immediately upon their accession, but is decreed to them in the progress of time, not as a matter of course, but as a final testimonial of the greatest services.

8 1 <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, who had been chosen praetor for Spain, was detained in the city by his creditors, as he owed much more than he could pay, by reason of his political expenses. He was reported as saying that he needed 25,000,000 sesterces5 in order to have nothing at all. However, he arranged with those who were detaining him as best he could and proceeded to Spain. Here he neglected the transaction of public business, the administration of justice, and all matters of that kind because he considered them of no use to his purposes, but he raised an army and attacked the independent Spanish tribes one by one until he made the whole country tributary to the Romans. He also sent much money to the public treasury at Rome. For these reasons the Senate awarded him a triumph. He was making preparations outside the walls for a most splendid procession, during the days when candidates for the consulship were required to present themselves. It was not lawful for one who was going to have a triumph to enter the city and then go back again for the triumph. As <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was very anxious to secure the office, and his procession was not yet ready, he sent to the Senate and asked permission to go through the forms of standing for the consulship while absent, through the instrumentalities of friends, for although he knew it was against the law it had been done by others. <persName n="104">Cato</persName> opposed his proposition and used up the last day for the presentation of candidates, in speech-making. Thereupon <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> abandoned his triumph, entered the city, offered himself as a candidate, and waited for the comitia.

9 1 In the meantime <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, who had acquired great glory and power by his Mithridatic war, was asking the Senate to ratify numerous concessions that he had granted to kings, princes, and cities. Most Senators, however, moved by envy, made opposition, and especially <persName n="311">Lucullus</persName>, who had held the command against <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName> before <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, and who considered that the victory was his, since he had left the king for <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> in a state of extreme weakness. <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> co-operated with <persName n="311">Lucullus</persName> in this matter. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> was indignant and made friends with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and promised under oath to support him for the consulship. The latter thereupon brought <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> into friendly relations with <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. So these three most powerful men pooled their interests. This coalition the Roman writer <persName n="556">Varro</persName> treated of in a book entitled Tricaranus (the three-headed monster).

The Senate had its suspicions of them and elected <persName n="75">Bibulus</persName> as <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s colleague to hold him in check; 10 1 and strife sprang up between them immediately and they proceeded to arm themselves secretly against each other. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, who was a master of dissimulation, made speeches in the Senate in the interest of concord to <persName n="75">Bibulus</persName>, insinuating that any differences between them might have serious results for the state. As he was believed to be sincere, <persName n="75">Bibulus</persName> was thrown off his guard, and while he was unprepared and unsuspecting <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> secretly got a large band of soldiers in readiness and brought before the Senate measures for the relief of the poor by the distribution of the public land to them. The best part of this land especially round Capua, which was leased for the public benefit, he proposed to bestow upon those who were the fathers of at least three children, by which means he bought for himself the favour of a multitude of men, for twenty thousand, being those only who had three children each, came forward at once. As many senators opposed his motion he pretended to be indignant at their injustice, and rushed out of the Senate and did not convene it again for the remainder of the year, but harangued the people from the rostra. In a public assembly he asked <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> what they thought about his proposed laws. Both gave their approval, and the people came to the voting-place carrying concealed daggers.

11 1 The Senate (since no one called it together and it was not lawful for one consul to do so without the consent of the other) assembled at the house of <persName n="75">Bibulus</persName>, but did nothing to counteract the force and preparation of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. They planned, however, that <persName n="75">Bibulus</persName> should opposite <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s laws, so that they should seem to be overcome by force rather than to suffer by their own negligence. Accordingly, <persName n="75">Bibulus</persName> burst into the forum while <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was still speaking. Strife and tumult arose, blows were given, and those who had daggers broke the fasces and insignia of <persName n="75">Bibulus</persName> and wounded some of the tribunes who stood around him. <persName n="75">Bibulus</persName> was in no wise terrified, but bared his neck to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s partisans and loudly called on them to strike. "If I cannot persuade <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> to do right," he said, "I will affix upon him the guilt and stigma of my death." His friends, however, led him, against his will, out of the crowd and into the neighbouring temple of Jupiter Stator. Then <persName n="104">Cato</persName> was summoned to the spot, and being a young man, forced his way to the midst of the crowd and began to make a speech, but was lifted up and carried out by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s partisans. Then he went around secretly by another street and again mounted the rostra; but as he despaired of making a speech, since nobody would listen to him, he abused <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> roundly until he was again lifted up and ejected by the <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>ians, and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> secured the enactment of his laws.

12 1 The plebeians swore to observe these laws for ever, and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> directed the Senate to do the same. Many of them, including <persName n="104">Cato</persName>, refused, and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> proposed and the people enacted the death penalty to the recusants. Then they became alarmed and took the oath, including the tribunes, for it was no longer of any use to speak against it after the law had been confirmed by the others. And now <persName n="595">Vettius</persName>, a plebeian, ran into the forum with a drawn dagger and said that he had been sent by <persName n="75">Bibulus</persName>, <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, and <persName n="104">Cato</persName> to kill <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, and that the dagger had been given to him by <persName n="433">Postumius</persName>, the lictor of <persName n="75">Bibulus</persName>. Although this affair was open to suspicion from either point of view, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> made use of it to inflame the multitude and postponed till the morrow the examination of the assailant. <persName n="595">Vettius</persName> was thrown into prison and killed the same night. As this transaction was variously commented on, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> did not let it pass unnoticed, but said that it had been done by the opposite party, who were afraid of exposure. Finally, the people furnished him a guard to protect him against conspirators, and <persName n="75">Bibulus</persName> abstained from public business altogether, as though he were a private citizen, and did not go out of his house for the remainder of his official term, while <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, having now sole administration of public affairs, did not make any further inquiry concerning <persName n="595">Vettius</persName>.

13 1 He brought forward new laws to win the favour of the multitude, and caused all of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s acts to be ratified, as he had promised him. The knights, who held the middle place in rank between the Senate and the plebeians, and were extremely powerful in all ways by reason of their wealth, and of the farming of the provincial revenues which they contracted for, and who kept for this purpose multitudes of very trusty servants, had been asking the Senate for a long time to release them from a part of what they owed to the treasury. The Senate regularly shelved the question. As <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> did not want anything of the Senate then, but was employing the people only, he released the publicans from the third part of their obligations. For this unexpected favour, which was far beyond their deserts, the knights extolled <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> to the skies. Thus a more powerful body of defenders than that of the plebeians was added to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s support through one political act. He gave spectacles and combats of wild beasts beyond his means, borrowing money on all sides, and surpassing all former exhibitions in lavish display and splendid gifts, in consequence of which he was appointed governor of both Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul for five years, with the command of four legions.

14 1 As <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> saw that he would be away from home a long time, and that envy would be greater in proportion to the greatness of the benefits conferred, he gave his daughter <persName n="245">Julia</persName> in marriage to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, although she was betrothed to <persName n="621">Servilius Caepio</persName>, because he feared that even a friend might become envious of his great success. He also promoted the boldest of his partisans to the principal offices for the ensuing year. He designated his friend <persName n="176">Gabinius</persName> as consul, with <persName n="283">Lucius Calpurnius Piso</persName> as his colleague, whose daughter, <persName n="94">Calpurnia</persName>, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> married, although <persName n="104">Cato</persName> cried out that the empire was become a mere matrimonial agency. For tribunes he chose <persName n="591">Vatinius</persName> and <persName n="117">Clodius</persName>, although the latter had been suspected of an intrigue with the wife of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself during a religious ceremony of women. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, however, did not bring him to trial owing to his popularity with the masses, but divorced his wife. Others prosecuted <persName n="117">Clodius</persName> for impiety at the sacred rites, and <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> was the counsel for the prosecution. When <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was called as a witness he refused to testify against <persName n="117">Clodius</persName>, but even raised him to the tribuneship as a foil to <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, who was already decrying the triumvirate as tending toward monarchy. Thus <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> turned a private grievance to useful account and benefited one enemy in order to revenge himself on another. It appears, however, that <persName n="117">Clodius</persName> had previously requited <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> by helping him to secure the governorship of Gaul.

15 1 Such were the acts of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s consulship. He then laid down his magistracy and proceeded directly to his new government. <persName n="117">Clodius</persName> now brought an accusation against <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> for putting <persName n="259">Lentulus</persName> and <persName n="109">Cethegus</persName> and their followers to death without trial. <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, who had exhibited the highest courage in that transaction, became utterly unnerved at his trial. He put on humble raiment and, defiled with squalor and dirt, supplicated those whom he met in the streets, not being ashamed to annoy people who knew nothing about the business, so that his doings excited laughter rather than pity by reason of his unseemly aspect. Into such trepidation did he fall at this single trial of his own, although he had been managing other people's causes successfully all his life. In like manner they say that <persName n="151">Demosthenes</persName> the Athenian did not stand his ground when himself accused, but fled before the trial. When <persName n="117">Clodius</persName> interrupted <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>'s supplications on the streets with contumely, he gave way to despair and, like <persName n="151">Demosthenes</persName>, went into voluntary exile. A multitude of his friends went out of the city with him, and the Senate gave him introductions to cities, kings, and princes. <persName n="117">Clodius</persName> demolished his house and his villas, and was so much elated by this affair that he compared himself with <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, who was then the most powerful man in Rome.

16 1 Accordingly, <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> held out to <persName n="368">Milo</persName>, who was <persName n="117">Clodius</persName>' colleague in office and a bolder spirit than himself, the hope of the consulship, and incited him against <persName n="117">Clodius</persName>, and directed him to procure a vote for the recall of <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>. He hoped that when <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> should come back he would no longer speak against the existing status (the triumvirate), remembering what he had suffered, but would make trouble for <persName n="117">Clodius</persName> and bring punishment upon him.

Thus <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, who had been exiled by means of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, was recalled by means of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> about sixteen months after his banishment, and the Senate rebuilt his house and his villas at the public expense. He was received magnificently at the city gates, and it is said that a whole day was consumed by the greetings extended to him, as was the case with <persName n="151">Demosthenes</persName> when he returned.

17 1 In the meantime <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, who had performed the many brilliant exploits in Gaul and Britain which have been described in my Celtic history, had returned with vast riches to Cisalpine Gaul on the river Po to give his army a short respite from continuous fighting. From this district he sent large sums of money to many persons in Rome, to those who were holding the yearly offices and to persons otherwise distinguished as governors and generals, and they went thither by turns to meet him.9 So many of them came that 120 lictors could be seen around him at one time, and more than 200 senators, some returning thanks for what they had already received, others asking for money or seeking some other advantage for themselves from the same quarter. All things were now possible to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> by reason of his large army, his great riches, and his readiness to oblige everybody. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and <persName n="133">Crassus</persName>, his partners in the triumvirate, came also. In their conference it was decided that <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> should be elected consuls again and that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s governorship over his provinces should be extended for five years more.

Thereupon they separated and <persName n="293">Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> offered himself as a candidate for the consulship against <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. When the appointed day came, both went down to the Campus Martius before daylight to attend the comitia. Their followers got into an altercation and came to blows, and finally somebody assaulted the torchbearer of <persName n="293">Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> with a sword. There was a scattering after this, and <persName n="293">Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> escaped with difficulty to his own house. Even <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s clothing was carried home stained with blood,10 so great was the danger incurred by both candidates.

18 1 Accordingly, <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> were chosen consuls and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s governorship was extended for five years according to the agreement. The provinces were allotted with an army to each consul in the following manner: <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> chose Spain and Africa, but sent friends to take charge of them, he himself remaining in Rome. <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> took Syria and the adjacent country because he wanted a war with the Parthians, which he thought would be easy as well as glorious and profitable. But when he took his departure from the city there were many unfavourable omens, and the tribunes forbade the war against the Parthians, who had done no wrong to the Romans. As he would not obey, they invoked public imprecations on him, which <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> disregarded; wherefore he perished in Parthia, together with his son of the same name and his army, not quite 10,000 of whom, out of 100,000, escaped to Syria. The disaster to <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> will be described in my Parthian history. As the Romans were suffering from scarcity, they appointed <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> the sole manager of the grain supply and gave him, as in his operations against the pirates, twenty assistants from the Senate. These he distributed in like manner among the provinces while he superintended the whole, and thus Rome was very soon provided with abundant supplies, by which means <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> again gained great reputation and power.

19 1 About this time <persName n="245">Julia</persName>, the daughter of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, who was married to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, died in childbirth, and fear fell upon all lest, with the termination of this marriage connection <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> with their great armies should come into conflict with each other, especially as the commonwealth had been for a long time disorderly and unmanageable. The magistrates were chosen by means of money, and faction fights, with dishonest zeal, with the aid of stones and even swords. Bribery and corruption prevailed in the most scandalous manner. The people themselves went already bought to the elections. A case was found where a deposit of 800 talents had been made to obtain the consulship. The consuls holding office yearly could not hope to lead armies or to command in war because they were shut out by the power of the triumvirate. The baser among them strove for gain, instead of military commands, at the expense of the public treasury or from the election of their own successors. For these reasons good men abstained from office altogether, and the disorder was such that at one time the republic was without consuls for eight months, <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> conniving at the state of affairs in order that there might be need of a dictator.

20 1 Many citizens began to talk to each other about this, saying that the only remedy for existing evils was the authority of a single ruler, but that there was need of a man who combined strength of character and mildness of temper, thereby indicating <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, who had a sufficient army under his command and who appeared to be both a friend of the people and a leader of the Senate by virtue of his rank, a man of temperance and self-control and easy of access, or at all events so considered. The expectation of a dictatorship <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> discountenanced in words, but in fact he did everything secretly to promote it, and went out of his way to overlook the prevailing disorder and the anarchy consequent upon the disorder. <persName n="368">Milo</persName>, who had assisted him in his controversy with <persName n="117">Clodius</persName>, and had acquired great popularity by the recall of <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, now sought the consulship, as he considered it a favourable time in view of the present anarchy; but <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> kept postponing the comitia until <persName n="368">Milo</persName>, believing that <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> was false to him, became disgusted, and withdrew to his native town of Lanuvium, which they say was the first city founded in Italy by Diomedes on his return from Troy, and which is situated about 150 stades from Rome.

21 1 <persName n="117">Clodius</persName> happened to be coming from his own country-seat on horseback and he met <persName n="368">Milo</persName> at Bovillae. They merely exchanged hostile scowls and passed along; but one of <persName n="368">Milo</persName>'s servants attacked <persName n="117">Clodius</persName>, either because he was ordered to do so or because he wanted to kill his master's enemy, and stabbed him through the back with a dagger. <persName n="117">Clodius</persName>' groom carried him bleeding into a neighbouring inn. <persName n="368">Milo</persName> followed with his servants and finished him, — whether he was still alive, or already dead, is not known — for, although he claimed that he had neither advised nor ordered the murder, he was not willing to leave the deed unfinished because he knew that he would be accused in any event. When the news of this affair was circulated in Rome, the people were thunderstruck, and they passed the night in the forum. When daylight came, the corpse of <persName n="117">Clodius</persName> was displayed on the rostra. Some of the tribunes and the friends of <persName n="117">Clodius</persName> and a great crowd with them seized it and carried it to the senate-house, either to confer honour upon it, as he was of senatorial birth, or as an act of contumely to the Senate for conniving at such deeds. There the most reckless ones collected the benches and chairs of the senators and made a funeral pyre for him, which they lighted and from which the senate-house and many buildings in the neighbourhood caught fire and were consumed along with the corpse of <persName n="117">Clodius</persName>.

22 1 Such was the superabundant hardihood of <persName n="368">Milo</persName> that he was moved less by fear of punishment for the murder than by indignation at the honour bestowed upon <persName n="117">Clodius</persName> at his funeral. He collected a crowd of slaves and rustics, and, after sending some money to be distributed among the people and buying <persName n="87">Caelius</persName>, one of the tribunes, he came back to the city with the greatest boldness. Directly he entered, <persName n="87">Caelius</persName> dragged him to the forum to be tried by those whom he had bribed, as though by an assembly of the people, pretending to be very indignant and not willing to grant any delay, but really hoping that if those present should acquit him he would escape a more regular trial. <persName n="368">Milo</persName> said that the deed was not premeditated, since nobody would set out with such intentions encumbered with his luggage and his wife. The remainder of his speech was directed against <persName n="117">Clodius</persName> as a desperado and a friend of desperadoes who had set fire to the senate-house and burned it to ashes over his body. While he was still speaking the other tribunes, with the unbribed portion of the people, burst into the forum armed. <persName n="87">Caelius</persName> and <persName n="368">Milo</persName> escaped disguised as slaves, but there was a great slaughter of the others. Search was not made for the friends of <persName n="368">Milo</persName>, but all who were met with, whether citizens or strangers, were killed, and especially those who wore fine clothes and gold rings. As the government was without order, these ruffians, who were for the most part slaves and were armed men against unarmed, indulged their rage and, making an excuse of the tumult that had broken out, they turned to pillage. They abstained from no crime, but broke into houses, looking for any kind of portable property, while pretending to be searching for the friends of <persName n="368">Milo</persName>. For several days <persName n="368">Milo</persName> was their excuse for burning, stoning, and every sort of outrage.

23 1 The Senate assembled in consternation and looked to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, intending to make him dictator at once, for they considered this necessary as a remedy for the present evils; but at the suggestion of <persName n="104">Cato</persName> they appointed him consul without a colleague, so that by ruling alone he might have the power of a dictator with the responsibility of a consul. He was the first of consuls who had two of the greatest provinces, and an army, and the public money, and autocratic power in the city, by virtue of being sole consul. In order that <persName n="104">Cato</persName> might not cause obstruction by his presence, he framed a decree that he should go to Cyprus and take the island away from King <persName n="961">Ptolemy</persName>— a law to that effect having been enacted by <persName n="117">Clodius</persName> because once, when he was captured by pirates, the avaricious <persName n="961">Ptolemy</persName> had contributed only two talents for his ransom. When <persName n="961">Ptolemy</persName> heard of the decree he threw his money into the sea and killed himself, and <persName n="104">Cato</persName> settled the government of Cyprus. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> then proposed the prosecution of offenders and especially of those guilty of bribery and corruption, for he thought that the seat of the public disorder was there, and that by beginning there he should effect a speedy cure. He brought forward a law, that any citizen who chose to do so might call for an account from anybody who had held office from the time of his own first consulship to the present. This embraced a period of a little less than twenty years, during which <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> also had been consul; wherefore <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s friends suspected that he included so long a time in order to cast reproach and contumely on <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and urged him to straighten out the present situation rather than stir up the past to the annoyance of so many distinguished men, among whom they named <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> pretended to be indignant at the mention of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s name, as though he were above suspicion, and said that his own second consulship was embraced in the period, and that he had gone back a considerable time in order to effect a complete cure of the evils from which the republic had been so long wasting away.

24 1 After making this answer he passed his law, and straightway there ensued a great number and variety of prosecutions. In order that the jurors might act without fear <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> superintended them in person, and stationed soldiers around them. The first defendants convicted were absentees: <persName n="368">Milo</persName> for the murder of <persName n="117">Clodius</persName>; <persName n="176">Gabinius</persName> both for violation of law and for impiety, because he had invaded Egypt without a decree of the Senate and contrary to the Sibylline books; <persName n="240">Hypsaeus</persName>, <persName n="353">Memmius</persName>, <persName n="529">Sextius</persName>, and many others for taking bribes and for corrupting the populace. The people interceded for <persName n="508">Scaurus</persName>, but <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> made proclamation that they should submit to the decision of the court. When the crowd again interrupted the accusers, <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s soldiers made a charge and killed several. Then the people held their tongues and <persName n="508">Scaurus</persName> was convicted. All the accused were banished, and <persName n="176">Gabinius</persName> was fined in addition. The Senate praised <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> highly for these proceedings, voted him two more legions, and extended the term of his provincial government. As <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s law offered impunity to any one who should turn state evidence, <persName n="353">Memmius</persName>, who had been convicted of bribery, called <persName n="363">Metellus Scipio</persName>, the father-in‑law of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> himself, to trial for like participation in bribery. Thereupon <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> put on mourning and many of the jurors did the same. <persName n="353">Memmius</persName> took pity on the republic and withdrew the accusation.

25 1 <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, as though he had completed the reforms that made autocratic power necessary, now made <persName n="363">Metellus Scipio</persName> his colleague in the consulship for the remainder of the year. At the expiration of his term, however, although others were invested with the consulship, he was none the less the supervisor, and ruler, and all-in‑all in Rome. He enjoyed the good-will of the Senate, particularly because they were jealous of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, who did not consult the Senate during his consulship, and because <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> had so speedily restored the sick commonwealth, and had not made himself offensive or troublesome to any of them during his term of office.

All who were banished went to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> in crowds and advised him to beware of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, saying that his law about bribery was especially directed against himself. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> cheered them up and spoke well of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. He also induced the tribunes to bring in a law to enable himself to stand for the consulship a second time while absent, and this was enacted while <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> was still consul and without opposition from him. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> suspected that the Senate would resist this project and feared lest he should be reduced to the condition of a private citizen and exposed to his enemies. So he tried to retain his power until he should be elected consul, and asked the Senate to grant him a little more time in his present command of Gaul, or of a part of it. <persName n="187">Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor</persName>, who succeeded <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> as consul, forbade it. They say that when this was announced to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, he clapped his hand on his sword-hilt and exclaimed, "This shall give it to me."

26 1 <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> built the town of Novum Comum at the foot of the Alps and gave it the Latin rights, which included a provision that those who had exercised year by year the chief magistracy should become Roman citizens. One of these men, who had been in office and was consequently considered a Roman citizen, was beaten with rods for some reason by order of <persName n="330">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</persName> in defiance of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> — a punishment that was never inflicted on Roman citizens. <persName n="330">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</persName> in his passion revealed his real intention that the blows should be the brand of the alien, and he told the man to carry his scars and show them to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. So insulting was <persName n="330">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</persName>. Moreover, he proposed to send successors to take command of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s provinces before his time had expired; but <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> interfered, making a pretence of fairness and good-will, saying that they ought not to put an indignity on a distinguished man who had been so extremely useful to his country, merely on account of a short interval of time; but he made it plain that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s command must come to an end immediately on its expiration.

For this reason the bitterest enemies of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> were chosen consuls for the ensuing year: <persName n="275">Lucius Aemilius Paulus</persName> and <persName n="187">Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor</persName>, cousin of the <persName n="330">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</persName> before mentioned. <persName n="138">Curio</persName>, who was also a bitter enemy of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, but extremely popular with the masses and a most accomplished speaker, was chosen tribune. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was not able to influence <persName n="187">Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor</persName> with money, but he bought the neutrality of Paulus for 1500 talents and the assistance of <persName n="138">Curio</persName> with a still larger sum, because he knew that the latter was heavily burdened with debt.

With the money thus obtained Paulus built and dedicated to the Roman people the Basilica that bears his name, a very beautiful structure, 27 1 while <persName n="138">Curio</persName>, in order that he might not be detected changing sides too suddenly, brought forward vast plans for repairing and building roads, of which he was to be superintendent for five years. He knew that he could not carry any such measure, but he hoped that <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s friends would oppose him, so that he might have that as a grievance against <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. Things turned out as he had anticipated, so that he had a pretext for disagreement. <persName n="187">Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor</persName> proposed the sending of successors to take command of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s provinces, as his term was now expiring. <persName n="275">Lucius Aemilius Paulus</persName> was silent. <persName n="138">Curio</persName>, who was thought to differ from both, seconded the motion of <persName n="187">Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor</persName>, but added that <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> ought to resign his provinces and army just like <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, for in this way he said the commonwealth would be made free and be relieved from fear in all directions. Many opposed this as unjust, because <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s term had not yet expired. Then <persName n="138">Curio</persName> came out more openly and harshly against sending successors to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> unless <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> also should lay down his command; for since they were both suspicious of each other, he contended that there could be no lasting peace to the commonwealth unless they should all be reduced to the character of private citizens. He said this because he saw that the people were incensed against <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> on account of his prosecutions for bribery. As <persName n="138">Curio</persName>'s position was plausible, the plebeians praised him as the only one who was willing to incur the enmity of both <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> in order to fulfil worthily his duties as a citizen; and once they escorted him home, scattering flowers, as though he were an athlete and had won the prize in some great and difficult contest; for nothing was considered more perilous then than to have a difference with <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>.

28 1 <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, while lying sick in Italy, wrote an artful letter to the Senate, praising <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s exploits and also recounting his own from the beginning, saying that he had been invested with a third consulship, and with provinces and an army afterward; these he had not solicited, but he had received them on being called upon to serve the state. As for the powers which he had accepted unwillingly, "I will gladly yield them," said he, "to those who wish to take them back, and will not wait the time fixed for their expiration." The artfulness of this communication consisted in showing the fairness of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and in exciting prejudice against <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, who did not seem likely to give up his command even at the appointed time. When <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> came back to the city, he spoke to the senators in the same way and then, also, promised to lay down his command. In virtue, of course, of his friendship and marriage connection with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> he said that the latter would very cheerfully do the same, for his had been a long and laborious contest against very warlike peoples; he had added much to the Roman power, and now he would come back to his honours, his sacrificial duties, and his relaxations. He said these things in order that successors to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> might be sent at once, while he himself should merely rest content with his promise. <persName n="138">Curio</persName> exposed his artifice, saying that promises were not sufficient, and insisting that <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> should lay down his command now and that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> should not be disarmed until <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> himself had returned to private life. On account of private enmity, he said, it would not be advisable either for <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> or for the Romans that such great authority should be held by one man. Rather should each of them have power against the other, in case one should attempt violence against the commonwealth. Now at last throwing off all disguise, he denounced <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> unsparingly as one aiming at supreme power, and said that unless he would lay down his command now, when he had the fear of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> before his eyes, he would never lay it down at all. He moved that, unless they both obeyed, both should be voted public enemies and military forces be levied against them. In this way he concealed the fact that he had been bought by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>.

29 1 <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> was angry with him and threatened him and at once withdrew indignantly to the environs. The Senate now had suspicions of both, but it considered <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> the better republican of the two, and it hated <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> because he had not shown it proper respect during his consulship. Some of the senators really thought that it would not be safe to the commonwealth to deprive <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> of his power until after <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> should lay down his, since the latter was outside of the city and was the man of more magnificent designs. <persName n="138">Curio</persName> held the contrary opinion, that they had need of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> against the power of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, or otherwise that both armies should be disbanded at the same time. As the Senate would not agree with him he dismissed it, leaving the whole business unfinished, having the power to do so as tribune. Thus <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> had occasion to regret that he had restored the tribunician power to its pristine vigour after it had been reduced to a mere shadow by <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>. Nevertheless, one decree was voted before the session was ended, and that was that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> should each send one legion of soldiers to Syria to defend the province on account of the disaster to <persName n="133">Crassus</persName>. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> artfully recalled the legion that he had lately lent to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> on account of the disaster to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s two generals, <persName n="570">Titurius</persName> and <persName n="131">Cotta</persName>. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> awarded to each soldier 250 drachmas and sent the legion to Rome together with another of his own.

30 1 As the expected danger did not show itself in Syria, these legions were sent into winter quarters at Capua. The persons who had been sent by <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> to bring these legions spread many reports derogatory to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and repeated them to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. They affirmed that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s army was wasted by protracted service, that the soldiers longed for their homes and would change to the side of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> as soon as they should cross the Alps. They spoke in this way either from ignorance or because they were corrupted. In fact, every soldier was strongly attached to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and laboured zealously for him, under the force of discipline and the influence of the gain which war usually brings to victors and which they received from <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> also; for he gave with a lavish hand in order to mould them to his designs. They knew what his designs were, but they stood by him nevertheless. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, however, believed what was reported to him and collected neither soldiers nor apparatus suitable for so great a contest. In the Senate the opinion of each member was asked and <persName n="187">Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor</persName> craftily divided the question and took the votes separately, thus: "Shall successors be sent to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>?" and again, "Shall <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> be deprived of his command?" The majority voted against the latter proposition, and it was decreed that successors to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> should be sent. Then <persName n="138">Curio</persName> put the question whether both should lay down their commands, and 22 senators voted in the negative while 370 went back to the opinion of <persName n="138">Curio</persName> in order to avoid civil discord. Then <persName n="187">Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor</persName> dismissed the Senate, exclaiming, "Enjoy your victory and have <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> for a master."

31 1 Suddenly a false rumour came that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had crossed the Alps and was marching on the city, whereupon there was a great tumult and consternation on all sides. <persName n="187">Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor</persName> moved that the army at Capua be turned against <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> as a public enemy. When <persName n="138">Curio</persName> opposed him on the ground that the rumour was false he exclaimed, "If I am prevented by the vote of the Senate from taking steps for the public safety, I will take such steps on my own responsibility as consul." After saying this he darted out of the Senate and proceeded to the environs with his colleague, where he presented a sword to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, and said, "I and my colleague command you to march against <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> in behalf of your country, and we give you for this purpose the army now at Capua, or in any other part of Italy, and whatever additional forces you yourself choose to levy." <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> promised to obey the orders of the consuls, but he added, "unless we can do better," thus dealing in trickery and still making a pretence of fairness. <persName n="138">Curio</persName> had no power outside the city (for it was not permitted to the tribunes to go beyond the walls), but he publicly deplored the state of affairs and demanded that the consuls should make proclamation that nobody need obey the conscription ordered by <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. As he could accomplish nothing, and as his term of office as tribune was about expiring, and he feared for his safety and despaired of being able to render any further assistance to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, he hastily departed to join him.

32 1 <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had lately recrossed the straits from Britain and, after traversing the Gallic country along the Rhine, had passed the Alps with 5000 foot and 300 horse and arrived at Ravenna, which was contiguous to Italy and the last town in his government. After embracing <persName n="138">Curio</persName> and returning thanks for what he had done for him, he reviewed the situation. <persName n="138">Curio</persName> advised him to bring his whole army together now and lead it to Rome, but <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> thought it best still to try to come to terms. So he directed his friends to make an agreement in his behalf, that he should deliver up all his provinces and soldiers, except that he should retain two legions and Illyria with Cisalpine Gaul until he should be elected consul. This was satisfactory to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, but the consuls refused. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> then wrote a letter to the Senate, which <persName n="138">Curio</persName> carried a distance of 1300 stades in three days and delivered to the newly-elected consuls as they entered the senate-house on the first of January.12 The letter embraced a calm recital of all that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had done from the beginning of his career and a proposal that he would lay down his command at the same time with <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, but that if <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> should retain his command he would not lay down his own, but would come quickly and avenge his country's wrongs and his own. When this letter was read, as it was considered a declaration of war, a vehement shout was raised on all sides that <persName n="293">Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> be <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s successor. <persName n="293">Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> took the field immediately with 4000 men from the active list.

33 1 Since <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="464">Quintus Cassius</persName>, who succeeded <persName n="138">Curio</persName> as tribunes, agreed with him in opinion, the Senate became more bitter than ever and declared <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s army the protector of Rome, and that of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> a public enemy. The consuls, <persName n="186">Gaius Claudius Marcellus</persName> and <persName n="260">Lentulus Crus</persName>, ordered <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and his friends out of the Senate lest they should suffer some harm, tribunes though they were. Then <persName n="27">Antony</persName> sprang from his chair in anger and with a loud voice called gods and men to witness the indignity put upon the sacred and inviolable office of tribune, saying that while they were expressing the opinion which they deemed best for the public interest, they were driven out with contumely though they had wrought no murder or outrage. Having spoken thus he rushed out like one possessed, predicting war, slaughter, proscription, banishment, confiscation, and various other impending evils, and invoking direful curses on the authors of them. <persName n="138">Curio</persName> and <persName n="464">Quintus Cassius</persName> rushed out with him, for a detachment of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s army was already observed standing around the senate-house. The tribunes made their way to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> the next night with the utmost speed, concealing themselves in a hired carriage, and disguised as slaves. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> showed them in this condition to his army, whom he excited by saying that his soldiers, after all their great deeds, had been stigmatized as public enemies and that distinguished men like these, who had dared to say a word for them, had been thus driven out with ignominy.

34 1 The war had now been begun on both sides and was already openly declared; but the Senate, thinking that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s army would be slow in arriving from Gaul and that he would not rush into so great an adventure with a small force, directed <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> to assemble 130,000 Italian soldiers, chiefly veterans who had had experience in war, and to recruit as many able-bodied men as possible from the neighbouring provinces. They voted him for the war all the money in the public treasury at once, and their own private fortunes in addition if they should be needed for the pay of the soldiers. With the fury of party rage they levied additional contributions on the allied cities, which they collected with the greatest possible haste. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had sent messengers to bring his own army, but as he was accustomed to rely upon the terror caused by the celerity and audacity of his movements, rather than on the magnitude of his preparations, he decided to take the aggressive in this great war with his 5000 men and to anticipate the enemy by seizing the advantageous positions in Italy.

35 1 Accordingly, he sent forward the centurions with a few of their bravest troops in peaceful garb to go inside the walls of Ariminum and take it by surprise. This was the first town in Italy after leaving Cisalpine Gaul. Toward evening <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself rose from a banquet on a plea of indisposition, leaving his friends who were still feasting. He mounted his chariot and drove toward Ariminum, his cavalry following at a short distance. When his course brought him to the river Rubicon, which forms the boundary line of Italy, he stopped and, while gazing at the stream, revolved in his mind the evils that would result, should he cross the river in arms. Recovering himself, he said to those who were present, "My friends, to leave this stream uncrossed will breed manifold distress for me; to cross it, for all mankind." Thereupon, he crossed with a rush like one inspired, uttering the familiar phrase, "The die is cast: so let it be!" Then he resumed his hasty journey and took possession of Ariminum about daybreak, advanced beyond it, stationed guards at the commanding positions, and, either by force or by kindness, mastered all whom he fell in with. As is usual in cases of panic, there was flight and migration from all the country-side in disorder and tears, the people having no exact knowledge, but thinking that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was pushing on with all his might and with an immense army.

36 1 When the consuls learned the facts they did not allow <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> to act according to his own judgment, experienced as he was in military affairs, but urged him to traverse Italy and raise troops, as though the city were on the point of being captured. The Senate also was alarmed at <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s unexpectedly swift advance, for which it was still unprepared, and in its panic repented that it had not accepted <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s proposals, which it at last considered fair, after fear had turned it from the rage of party to the counsels of prudence. Many portents and signs in the sky took place. It rained blood. Sweat issued from the statues of the gods. Lightning struck several temples. A mule foaled. There were many other prodigies which betokened the overturn and change for all time in the form of government. Prayers were offered up in public as was customary in times of danger, and the people who remembered the evil times of <persName n="602">Marius</persName> and <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, clamoured that both <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> ought to lay down their commands as the only means of averting war. <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> proposed to send messengers to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> in order to come to an arrangement.

37 1 As the consuls opposed all accommodation, <persName n="164">Favonius</persName>, in ridicule of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> for something he had said a little before, advised him to stamp on the ground with his foot and raise up from it the promised armies. "You can have them," replied <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, "if you will follow me and not be horrified at the thought of leaving Rome, and Italy also if need be. Places and houses are not strength and freedom to men; but men, wherever they may be, have these qualities within themselves, and by defending themselves will recover their homes also." After saying this and threatening those who should remain behind and desert their country's cause in order to save their fields and goods, he left the Senate and the city immediately to take command of the army at Capua, and the consuls followed him. The other senators remained undecided a long time and passed the night together in the senate-house. At daybreak, however, most of them departed and hastened after <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>.

38 1 At Corfinium <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> came up with and besieged <persName n="293">Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>, who had been sent to be his successor in the command of Gaul, but who did not have all of his 4000 men with him. The inhabitants of Corfinium captured him at the gates, as he was trying to escape, and brought him to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. The latter received the soldiers of <persName n="293">Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>, who offered themselves to him, with kindness, in order to encourage others to join him, and he allowed <persName n="293">Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> to go unharmed wherever he liked, and to take his own money with him. He hoped perhaps that <persName n="293">Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> would stay with him on account of this beneficence, but he did not prevent him from joining <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. While these transactions were taking place thus swiftly, <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> hastened from Capua to Nuceria and thence to Brundusium in order to cross the Adriatic to Epirus and complete his preparations for war there. He wrote letters to all the provinces and the commanders thereof, to princes, kings, and cities to send aid for carrying on the war with the greatest possible speed, and this they did zealously. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s own army was in Spain ready to move wherever it might be needed.

39 1 <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> gave some of the legions he already had in Italy to the consuls to be moved from Brundusium to Epirus, and the consuls crossed safely to Dyrrachium, which some persons, by reason of the following error, consider the same as Epidamnus. A barbarian king of the region, Epidamnus by name, built a city on the sea-coast and named it after himself. Dyrrachus, the son of his daughter and of Neptune (as is supposed), added a dockyard to it which he named Dyrrachium. When the brothers of this Dyrrachus made war against him, Hercules, who was returning from Erythrea, formed an alliance with him for a part of his territory; wherefore the men of Dyrrachium claim Hercules as their founder because he had a share of their land, not that they repudiate Dyrrachus, but because they pride themselves on Hercules even more as a god. In the battle which took place it is said that Hercules killed Ionius, the son of Dyrrachus, by mistake, and that after raising a barrow he threw the body into the sea in order that it might bear his name. At a later period the Briges, returning from Phrygia, took possession of the city and the surrounding country. They were supplanted by the Taulantii, an Illyrian tribe, who were displaced in their turn by the Liburnians, another Illyrian tribe, who were in the habit of making piratical expeditions against their neighbours with very swift ships. Hence the Romans call swift ships Liburnians because these were the first ones they came in conflict with. The people who had been expelled from Dyrrachium by the Liburnians procured the aid of the Corcyreans, who then ruled the sea, and drove out the Liburnians. The Corcyreans mingled their own colonists with them and thus it came to be considered a Greek port; but the Corcyreans changed its name, because they considered it unpropitious, and called it Epidamnus from the town just above it, and <persName n="561">Thucydides</persName> gives it that name also. Nevertheless, the former name prevailed finally and it is now called Dyrrachium.

40 1 A portion of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s forces had crossed to Dyrrachium with the consuls. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> led the remainder to Brundusium, where he awaited the return of the ships that had carried the others over. Here <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> advanced against him, and he defended himself from behind the walls and dug trenches to cut off the city until his fleet came back. Then he took his departure in the early morning, leaving the bravest of his troops on the walls. These also sailed away after nightfall, with a favourable wind.

Thus <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and his whole army abandoned Italy and passed over to Epirus. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, seeing the general drift of public opinion toward <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, was at a loss which way to turn or from what point to begin the war. As he had apprehensions of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s army in Spain, which was large and well disciplined by long service (lest while he was pursuing <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> it should fall upon his rear), he decided to march to Spain and destroy that army first. He now divided his forces into five parts, one of which he left at Brundusium, another at Hydrus, and another at Tarentum to guard Italy. Another he sent under command of <persName n="482">Quintus Valerius</persName> to take possession of the grain-producing island of Sardinia, which was done. He sent <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> to Sicily, which was then under the command of <persName n="104">Cato</persName>. When <persName n="104">Cato</persName> asked him whether he had brought the order of the Senate, or that of the people, to take possession of a government that had been assigned to another, <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> replied, "The master of Italy has sent me on this business."

<persName n="104">Cato</persName> answered that in order to spare the lives of those under his command he would not make resistance there. He then sailed away to Corcyra and from Corcyra to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. 41 1 <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> meanwhile hastened to Rome. He found the people shuddering with recollection of the horrors of <persName n="602">Marius</persName> and <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, and he cheered them with the prospect and promise of clemency. In proof of his kindness to his enemies, he said that he had taken <persName n="293">Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> prisoner and allowed him to go away unharmed with his money. Nevertheless, he hewed down the bars of the public treasury, and when <persName n="365">Metellus</persName>, one of the tribunes, tried to prevent him from entering threatened him with death. He took away money hitherto untouched, which, they say, had been deposited there long ago, at the time of the Gallic invasion, with a public curse upon anybody who should take it out except in case of a war with the Gauls. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> said that he had subjugated the Gauls completely and thus released the commonwealth from the curse. He then placed <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> in charge of the city, and the tribune, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, in charge of Italy and of the army guarding it. Outside of Italy he chose <persName n="138">Curio</persName> to take command of Sicily in place of <persName n="104">Cato</persName>, and <persName n="482">Quintus Valerius</persName> for Sardinia. He sent <persName n="178">Gaius Antonius</persName> to Illyria and entrusted Cisalpine Gaul to <persName n="248">Crassus</persName>. He ordered the building of two fleets with all speed, one in the Adriatic and the other in the Tyrrhenian sea, and appointed <persName n="239">Quintus Hortensius</persName> and <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> their admirals while they were still under construction.

42 1 Having prevailed so far as to make Italy inaccessible to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> went to Spain, where he encountered <persName n="405">Petreius</persName> and <persName n="8">Afranius</persName>, <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s lieutenants, and was worsted by them at first and afterward had an indecisive engagement with them near the town of Ilerta. He pitched his camp on some high ground and obtained his supplies by means of a bridge across the river Sicoris. Suddenly a spate carried way his bridge and cut off a great number of his men on the opposite side, who were destroyed by the forces of <persName n="405">Petreius</persName>. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself, with the rest of his army, suffered very severely from the difficulty of the site, from hunger, from the weather, and from the enemy, his situation being in no wise different from that of a siege. Finally, on the approach of summer, <persName n="8">Afranius</persName> and <persName n="405">Petreius</persName> withdrew to the interior of Spain to recruit more soldiers, but <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> continually anticipated them, blocked their passage, and prevented their advance. He also surrounded one of their divisions that had been sent forward to capture his camp. They raised their shields over their heads in token of surrender, but <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> neither captured nor slaughtered them, but allowed them to go back to <persName n="8">Afranius</persName> unharmed, after his usual manner of winning the favour of his enemies. Hence it came to pass that there was continual intercourse between the camps and talk of reconciliation among the rank and file.

43 1 To <persName n="8">Afranius</persName> and some of the other officers it now seemed best to abandon Spain to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, provided they could go unharmed to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. <persName n="405">Petreius</persName> opposed this and ran through the camp killing those of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s men whom he found holding communication with his own. He even slew with his own hand one of his officers who tried to restrain him. Moved by these acts of severity on the part of <persName n="405">Petreius</persName>, the minds of the soldiers were still more attracted to the clemency of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. Soon afterward <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> managed to cut off the enemy's access to water, and <persName n="405">Petreius</persName> was compelled by necessity to come with <persName n="8">Afranius</persName> to a conference with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> between the two armies. Here it was agreed that they should abandon Spain to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and that he should conduct them unharmed to the other side of the river <persName n="589">Varus</persName> and allow them to proceed thence to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. Arrived at this stream, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> called a meeting of all those who were from Rome or Italy and addressed them as follows: "My enemies (for by still using this term I shall make my meaning clearer to you), I did not destroy those of you who surrendered to me when you had been sent to seize my camp, nor the rest of your army when I had cut you off from water, although <persName n="405">Petreius</persName> had previously slaughtered those of my men who were intercepted on the other side of the river Sicoris. If there is any gratitude among you for these favours tell them to all of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s soldiers." After speaking thus he dismissed them uninjured, and he appointed <persName n="464">Quintus Cassius</persName> governor of Spain.

These were the operations of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. 44 1 Meanwhile in Africa <persName n="589">Varus</persName> commanded the Pompeian forces, and <persName n="242">Juba</persName>, king of the Numidians, was in alliance with him. <persName n="138">Curio</persName> sailed from Sicily against them in behalf of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> with two legions, twelve war vessels, and a number of ships of burden. He landed at Utica and put to flight a body of Numidian horse in a small cavalry engagement near that place, and allowed himself to be saluted as Imperator by the soldiers with their arms still in their hands. This title is an honour conferred upon generals by their soldiers, who thus testify that they consider them worthy to be their commanders. In the olden times the generals accepted this honour only for the greatest exploits. At present I understand that the distinction is limited to cases where at least 10,000 of the enemy have been killed. While <persName n="138">Curio</persName> was crossing from Sicily the inhabitants of Africa, thinking that, in emulation of the glory of <persName n="510">Scipio Africanus</persName>, he would establish his quarters near the camp of the latter, poisoned the water in the neighbourhood. Their expectation was fulfilled. <persName n="138">Curio</persName> encamped there and his army immediately fell sick. When they drank the water their eyesight became dim as in a mist, and sleep with torpor ensued, and after that frequent vomiting and spasms of the whole body. For this reason <persName n="138">Curio</persName> changed his camp to the neighbourhood of Utica itself, leading his enfeebled army through an extensive marshy region. But when they received the news of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s victory in Spain they took courage and put themselves in order of battle in a narrow space along the seashore. Here a severe battle was fought in which <persName n="138">Curio</persName> lost only one man, while <persName n="589">Varus</persName> lost 600 killed, besides a still larger number wounded.

45 1 Meantime, while <persName n="242">Juba</persName> was advancing, a false report preceded him, that he had turned back at the river Bagradas, which was not far distant, because his kingdom had been invaded by his neighbours, and that he had left <persName n="497">Saburra</persName>, his general, with a small force at the river. <persName n="138">Curio</persName> believed this report and about the third hour of a hot summer day led the greater part of his army against <persName n="497">Saburra</persName> by a sandy road destitute of water; for even if there were any streams there in winter they were dried up by the heat of the sun. He found the river in possession of <persName n="497">Saburra</persName> and of the king himself. Disappointed in his expectation <persName n="138">Curio</persName> retreated to some hills, oppressed by fatigue, heat, and thirst. When the enemy beheld him in this condition they crossed the river prepared for fight. <persName n="138">Curio</persName> despised the danger and very imprudently led his enfeebled army down to the plain, where he was surrounded by the Numidian horse. Here for some time he sustained the attack by retiring slowly and drawing his men together into a small space, but being much distressed he retreated again into the hills. <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName>, at the beginning of the trouble, had retreated with a small force to the camp at Utica lest <persName n="589">Varus</persName> should make an attack upon it as soon as he should hear the news of the disaster at the river. <persName n="138">Curio</persName> perished fighting bravely, together with all his men, not one returning to Utica to join <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName>.

46 1 Such was the result of the battle at the river Bagradas. <persName n="138">Curio</persName>'s head was cut off and carried to <persName n="242">Juba</persName>. As soon as the news of this disaster reached the camp at Utica, <persName n="587">Flamma</persName>, the admiral, fled, fleet and all, not taking a single one of the land forces on board, but <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> rowed out in a small boat to the merchant ships that were lying at anchor near by and besought them to come to the shore and take the army on board. Some of them did so by night, but the soldiers came aboard in such crowds that some of the small boats were sunk. Of those who were carried out to sea, and who had money with them, many were thrown overboard by the merchants for the sake of the money. So much for those who put to sea, but similar calamities, while it was still night, befell those who remained on shore. At daybreak they surrendered themselves to <persName n="589">Varus</persName>, but <persName n="242">Juba</persName> came up and, having collected them under the walls, put them all to the sword, claiming that they were the remainder of his victory, and paying no attention to the remonstrances of even <persName n="589">Varus</persName> himself. Thus the two Roman legions that sailed to Africa with <persName n="138">Curio</persName>, were totally destroyed, together with the cavalry, the light-armed troops, and the servants belonging to the army. <persName n="242">Juba</persName>, after vaunting his great exploit to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, returned home.

47 1 About this time <persName n="177">Gaius Antonius</persName> was defeated in Illyria by <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s lieutenant, <persName n="531">Octavius</persName>, and another army of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> mutinied at Placentia, crying out against their officers for prolonging the war and not paying them the five minae that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had promised them as a donative while they were still at Brundusium. When <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> heard of this he flew from Massilia to Placentia and coming before the soldiers, who were still in a state of mutiny, addressed them as follows: "You know what kind of speed I use in everything I undertake. This war is not prolonged by us, but by the enemy, who keep retiring from us. You reaped great advantages from my command in Gaul, and you took an oath to me for the whole of this war and not for a part only; and now you abandon us in the midst of our labours, you revolt against your officers, you propose to give orders to those from whom you are bound to receive orders. Being myself the witness of my liberality to you heretofore I shall now execute the law of our country by decimating the ninth legion, where this mutiny began." Straightway a cry went up from the whole legion, and the officers threw themselves at <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s feet in supplication. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> yielded little by little and so far remitted the punishment as to designate 120 only (who seemed to have been the leaders of the revolt), and chose twelve of these by lot to be put to death. One of the twelve proved that he was absent when the conspiracy was formed, and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> put to death in his stead the centurion who had accompanied him.

48 1 After thus quelling the mutiny at Placentia <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> proceeded to Rome, where the trembling people chose him dictator without any decree of the Senate and without the intervention of a magistrate. But he, either deprecating the office as likely to prove invidious or not desiring it, after holding it only eleven days (as some say) designated himself and <persName n="449">Publius Isauricus</persName> as consuls. He appointed or changed the governors of provinces according to his own pleasure. He assigned <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> to Spain, <persName n="62">Aulus Albinus</persName> to Sicily, <persName n="533">Sextus Peducaeus</persName> to Sardinia, and <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> to the newly acquired Gaul. He distributed corn to the starving people and at their petition he allowed the return of all exiles except <persName n="368">Milo</persName>. When he was asked to decree an abolition of debts, on the ground that the wars and seditions had caused a fall of prices, he refused it, but appointed appraisers of saleable goods which debtors might give to their creditors instead of money. When this had been done, about the winter solstice, he sent for his whole army to rendezvous at Brundusium and he himself took his departure in the month of December, according to the Roman calendar, not waiting for the beginning of his consulship on the calends of the new year, which was close at hand. The people followed him to the city gates, urging him to come to an arrangement with <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, for it was evident that whichever of the two should conquer would assume sovereign power.

49 1 <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> departed on his journey and travelled with all possible speed, but in the meantime <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> was using all diligence to build ships and collect additional forces of men and money. He captured forty of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s ships in the Adriatic and guarded against his crossing. He disciplined his army and took part in the exercises of both infantry and cavalry, and was foremost in everything, notwithstanding his age. In this way he readily gained the good-will of his soldiers; and the people flocked to see <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s military drills as to a spectacle. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> at that time had ten legions of infantry and 10,000 Gallic horse. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> had five legions from Italy, with which he had crossed the Adriatic, and the cavalry belonging to them; also the two surviving legions that had served with <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> in the Parthian war and a certain part of those who had made the incursion into Egypt with <persName n="176">Gabinius</persName>, making altogether eleven legions of Italian troops and about 7000 horse. He had auxiliaries also from Ionia, Macedonia, Peloponnesus, and Boeotia, Cretan archers, Thracian slingers, and Pontic javelin-throwers. He had also some Gallic horse and others from eastern Galatia, together with Commageneans sent by Antiochus, Cilicians, Cappadocians, and Pisidians. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> did not intend to use all these for fighting. Some were employed in garrison duty, in building fortifications, and in other service for the Italian soldiers, so that none of the latter should be kept away from the battles. Such were <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s land forces. He had 600 war-ships perfectly equipped, of which about 100 were manned by Romans and were understood to be much superior to the rest. He also had a great number of transports and ships of burden. There were numerous naval commanders for the different divisions, and <persName n="75">Bibulus</persName> had the chief command over all.

50 1 When all was in readiness <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> called the senators, the knights, and the whole army to an assembly and addressed them as follows: "Fellow-soldiers, the Athenians, too, abandoned their city for the sake of liberty when they were fighting against invasion, because they believed that it was not houses that made a city, but men;15 and after they had done so they presently recovered it and made it more renowned than even before. So, too, our own ancestors abandoned the city when the Gauls invaded it, and <persName n="96">Camillus</persName> hastened from Ardea and recovered it. All men of sound mind think that their country is wherever they can preserve their liberty. Because we were thus minded we sailed hither, not as deserters of our native land, but in order to prepare ourselves to defend it gloriously against one who has long conspired against it, and, by means of bribe-takers, has at last seized Italy by a sudden invasion. You have decreed him a public enemy, yet he now sends governors to take charge of your provinces. He appoints others over the city and still others throughout Italy. With such audacity has he deprived the people of their own government. If he does these things while the war is still raging and while he is apprehensive of the result and when we intend, with heaven's help, to bring him to punishment, what cruelty, what violence is he likely to abstain from if he wins the victory? And while he is doing these things against the fatherland certain men, who have been bought with money that he obtained from our province of Gaul, co-operate with him, choosing to be his slaves instead of his equals.

51 1 "I have not failed and I never will fail to fight with you and for you. I give you my services both as soldier and as general. If I have any experience in war, if it has been my good fortune to remain unvanquished to this day, I pray the gods to continue all these blessings in our present need, and that I may become a man of happy destiny for my country in her perils as I was in extending her dominion. Surely we may trust in the gods and in the righteousness of the war, which has for its noble and just object the defence of our country's constitution. In addition to this we may rely upon the magnitude of the preparations which we behold on land and sea, which are all the time growing and will be augmented still more as soon as we come into action. We may say that all the nations of the East and around the Euxine Sea, both Greek and barbarian, stand with us; and kings, who are friends of the Roman people or of myself, are supplying us soldiers, arms, provisions, and other implements of war. Come to your task then with a spirit worthy of your country, of yourself, and of me, mindful of the wrongs you have received from <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and ready to obey my orders promptly."

52 1 When <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> had thus spoken the whole army, including the senators and a great many of the nobility who were with him, applauded him vociferously and told him to lead them to whatsoever task he would. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> thought that as the season was bad and the sea harbourless <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> would not attempt to cross till the end of winter, but would be occupied in the meantime with his duties as consul. So he ordered his naval officers to keep watch over the sea, and then divided his army and sent it into winter quarters in Thessaly and Macedonia.

So heedlessly did <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> form his judgment of what was about to take place. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, as I have already said, hastened to Brundusium about the winter solstice, intending to strike terror into his enemies by taking them by surprise. Although he found neither provisions, nor apparatus, nor his whole army collected at Brundusium, he, nevertheless, called those who were present to an assembly and addressed them as follows:—

53 1 "Fellow soldiers — you who are joined with me in the greatest of undertakings — neither the winter weather, nor the delay of our comrades, nor the want of suitable preparation shall check my onset. I consider rapidity of movement the best substitute for all these things. I think that we who are first at the rendezvous should leave behind us here our servants, our pack-animals, and all our apparatus in order that ships which are here may hold us, and that we should embark alone and cross over at once without the enemy's knowledge. Let us oppose our good fortune to the winter weather, our courage to the smallness of our numbers, and to our want of supplies the abundance of the enemy, which will be ours to take as soon as we touch the land, if we realize that unless we conquer nothing is our own. Let us go then and possess ourselves of their servants, their apparatus, their provisions, while they are spending the winter under cover. Let us go while <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> thinks that I am spending my time in winter quarters also, or in processions and sacrifices appertaining to my consulship. It is needless to tell you that the most potent thing in war is unexpectedness. It will be glorious for us to carry off the first honours of the coming conflict and to make everything safe in advance yonder for those who will immediately follow us. For my part I would rather now be sailing than talking, so that I may come in <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s sight while he thinks me engaged in my official duties at Rome. I am certain that you agree with me, but yet I await your response."

54 1 The whole army cried out with enthusiasm that he should lead on. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> at once led, direct from the platform to the seashore, five legions of foot-soldiers and 600 chosen horse, but as a storm came up he was obliged to anchor off shore. It was now the winter solstice and the wind kept him back, chafing and disappointed, and held him in Brundusium until the first day of the new year. In the meantime two more legions arrived and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> embarked these also and started in the winter time on merchant ships, for he had only a few war-ships and these were guarding Sardinia and Sicily. The ships were driven by the winds to the Ceraunian Mountains and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> sent them back immediately to bring the rest of the army. He then marched by night against the town of Oricum by a rough and narrow path, with his force divided in several parts on account of the difficulties of the road, so that if anyone had observed it he might have been easily beaten. With much trouble he got his detachments together about daylight and the commander of the garrison of Oricum, having been forbidden by the townsmen to oppose the entrance of a Roman consul, delivered the keys of the place to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and remained with him in a position of honour. <persName n="310">Lucretius</persName> and <persName n="370">Minucius</persName>, who were on the other side of Oricum with eighteen war-ships guarding merchant ships loaded with corn for <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, sunk the latter to prevent them from falling into <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s hands, and fled to Dyrrachium. From Oricum <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> hastened to Apollonia, the inhabitants of which received him. <persName n="546">Straberius</persName>, the commander of the garrison, abandoned the city.

55 1 <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> assembled his army and congratulated them on the success they had achieved by their rapid movement in mid-winter, on conquering such a sea without war-ships, on taking Oricum and Apollonia without a fight, and on capturing the enemy's supplies, as he had predicted, without <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s knowledge. "If we can anticipate him in reaching Dyrrachium, his military arsenal," he added, "we shall be in possession of all the things they have collected by the labours of a whole summer." After speaking thus he led his soldiers directly toward Dyrrachium over a long road, not stopping day or night. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, being advised beforehand, marched toward the same place from Macedonia with extreme haste also, cutting down trees along the road, in order to obstruct <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s passage, destroying bridges, and setting fire to all the supplies he met with, considering it at the same time of the greatest importance (as it was) to safeguard his own stores. If either army saw any dust, or fire, or smoke at a distance they thought it was caused by the other, and they strove like athletes in a race. They did not allow themselves time for food or sleep. All was haste and eagerness mingled with the shouts of guides who carried torches, causing tumult and fear as the hostile armies were ever drawing nearer and nearer to each other. Some of the soldiers from fatigue threw away their loads. Others hid themselves in ravines and were left behind, exchanging their fear of the enemy for the rest which the moment craved.

56 1 In the midst of such distresses on either side <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> arrived first at Dyrrachium and encamped near it. He sent a fleet and retook Oricum and kept the strictest watch on the sea. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> pitched his camp so that the river Alor17 ran between himself and <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. By crossing the stream they had occasional cavalry skirmishes with each other, but the armies did not come to a general engagement, for <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> was still exercising his new levies and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> waited for the forces left at Brundusium. The latter apprehended that if these should sail in merchant ships in the spring they would not escape <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s triremes, which would be patrolling the sea, as guard ships, in great numbers, but if they should cross in winter while the enemy were lying inside among the islands they might perhaps be unnoticed, or might force their way by the strength of the wind and the size of their ships. So he sent orders to them to hasten. As they did not start he decided to cross over secretly to that army, because no one else could bring them so easily. He concealed his intention and sent three servants to the river, a distance of twelve stades, to procure a fast-sailing boat with a first rate pilot, saying that it was for a messenger sent by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>.

57 1 Rising from supper he pretended to be fatigued and told his friends to remain at the table. He put on the clothing of a private person, stepped into a carriage, and drove away to the ship, pretending to be the messenger sent by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. He gave the rest of his orders through his servants and remained concealed by the darkness of the night and unrecognized. As there was a severe wind blowing the servants told the pilot to be of good courage and seize this opportunity to avoid the enemy who were in the neighbourhood. The pilot made his way down the river by rowing, but when they came toward the mouth they found it broken into surf by the wind and the sea. The pilot, urged by the servants, put forth all his efforts, but as he could make no progress fatigue and despair came upon him. Then <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> threw off his disguise and called out to him, "Brave the tempest with a stout heart, you carry <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s fortunes." Both the rowers and pilot were astounded and all took fresh courage and gained the mouth of the river, but the wind and waves violently tossed the ship high on towards the bank. As the dawn was near and they feared lest the enemy should discover them in the daylight, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, blaming the ill-will of his evil genius, allowed the ship to return. So the ship sailed up the river with a strong wind. 58 1 Some of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s friends were astonished at this act of bravery; while others blamed him, saying that it was a deed becoming a soldier but not a general. As <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> saw that he could not conceal a second attempt he ordered <persName n="433">Postumius</persName> to sail to Brundusium in his place and tell <persName n="176">Gabinius</persName> to cross over with the army immediately, and if he did not obey, to give the same order to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and if he failed then to give it to <persName n="92">Calenus</persName>. Another letter was written to the whole army in case all three should hesitate, saying, "that everyone who was willing to do so should follow <persName n="433">Postumius</persName> on shipboard and sail to any place where the wind might carry them, and not to mind what happened to the ships, because <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> did not want ships but men."

Thus did <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> put his trust in fortune rather than in prudence. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, in order to anticipate <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s reinforcements, made haste and led his army forward prepared for battle. While two of his soldiers were searching in midstream for the best place to cross the river, one of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s men attacked and killed them both, whereupon <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> drew back, as he considered this event inauspicious. All of his friends blamed him for missing this capital opportunity.

59 1 When <persName n="433">Postumius</persName> arrived at Brundusium <persName n="176">Gabinius</persName> did not obey the order, but led those who were willing to go with him by way of Illyria by forced marches. Almost all of them were destroyed by the Illyrians and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was obliged to endure the outrage as he could not spare time for vengeance. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> embarked the remainder of the army and sailed past Apollonia with a strong favouring wind. About noon the wind failed and twenty of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s ships, that had put out to search the sea, discovered and pursued them. There was great fear on <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s vessels lest in this calm the warships of the enemy should ram them with their prows and sink them. They prepared for battle and began to discharge stones and darts, when suddenly the wind sprang up stronger than before, filled their great sails unexpectedly, and enabled them to complete their voyage without fear. The pursuers were left behind and they suffered severely from the wind and waves in the narrow sea and were scattered along a harbourless and rocky coast. With difficulty they captured two of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s ships that ran on a shoal. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> brought the remainder to the port of Nymphaeum.

60 1 By this time <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had his whole army concentrated together and <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> his. They encamped opposite each other on hills in numerous redoubts. There were frequent collisions around each of these redoubts while they were making lines of circum­vallation and trying to cut off each other's supplies. In one of these fights in front of a redoubt <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s men were worsted, and a centurion, of the name of <persName n="506">Scaeva</persName>, while performing many deeds of valour, was wounded in the eye with a dart. He advanced in front of his men beckoning with his hand as though he wished to say something. When silence was obtained he called out to one of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s centurions, who was likewise distinguished for bravery, "Save your comrade, your friend, and send somebody to lead me by the hand, for I am wounded." Two soldiers advanced to him thinking that he was a deserter. One of these he killed before the stratagem was discovered and he shore off the shoulder of the other. This he did because he despaired of saving himself and his redoubt. His men, moved by shame at this act of self-devotion, rushed forward and saved the redoubt. <persName n="370">Minucius</persName>, the commander of the post, also suffered severely. It is said that he received 120 missiles on his shield, was wounded six times, and like <persName n="506">Scaeva</persName>, lost an eye. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> honoured them both with many military gifts. He himself, as an offer for the betrayal of the town had been made from Dyrrachium, went by agreement with a small force by night to the gates at the temple of Artemis. . . .18

The same winter <persName n="363">Metellus Scipio</persName>, <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s father-in‑law, advanced with another army from Syria. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s general, <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName>, had an engagement with him in Macedonia, was beaten, and lost a whole legion except 800 men.

61 1 As <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> could obtain no supplies by sea, on account of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s naval superiority, his army began to suffer famine and was compelled to make bread from roots. When deserters brought loaves of this kind to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, thinking that he would be gladdened by the spectacle, he was not at all pleased, but said, "What wild beasts we are fighting with!" Then <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, compelled by necessity, drew his whole army together in order to force <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> to fight even against his will. The latter occupied a number of the redoubts that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had vacated and refused to move. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was greatly vexed at this and ventured upon an extremely difficult and chimerical task; that is, to carry a line of circum­vallation around the whole of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s positions from sea to sea, thinking that even if he should fail he would acquire great renown from the boldness of the enterprise. The circuit was 1200 stades.19 <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> actually began this great work, but <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> built a corresponding line of trench and rampart. Thus they parried each other's efforts. Nevertheless, they fought one great battle in which <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> defeated <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> in the most brilliant manner and pursued his men in headlong flight to his camp and took many of his standards. The eagle (the standard held in highest honour by the Romans) was saved with difficulty, the bearer having just time to throw it over the palisade to those within.

62 1 After this remarkable defeat <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> brought up other troops from another quarter, but these also fell into a panic even when they beheld <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> still far distant. Although they were already close to the gates they would neither make a stand, nor enter in good order, nor obey the commands given to them, but all fled pell-mell without shame, without orders, without reason. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> ran among them and with reproaches showed them that <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> was still far distant, yet under his very eye some threw down their standards and fled, while others bent their gaze upon the ground in shame and did nothing; so great consternation had befallen them. One of the standard bearers, with his standard reversed, dared to thrust the end of it at <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself, but the bodyguard cut him down. When the soldiers entered the camp they did not station any guards. All precautions were neglected and the fortification was left unprotected, so that it is probable that <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> might then have captured it and brought the war to an end by that one engagement had not <persName n="251">Labienus</persName>, in some heaven-sent lunacy, persuaded him to pursue the fugitives instead. Moreover <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> himself hesitated, either because he suspected a stratagem when he saw the gates unguarded or because he contemptuously supposed the war already decided by this battle. So he turned against those outside of the camp and made a heavy slaughter and took twenty-eight standards in the two engagements of the day, but he here missed his second opportunity to give the finishing stroke to the war. It is reported that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> said, "The war would have been ended to‑day in the enemy's favour if they had had a commander who knew how to make use of victory."

63 1 <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> sent letters to all the kings and cities magnifying his victory, and he expected that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s army would come over to him directly, conceiving that it was oppressed by hunger and cast down by defeat, and especially the officers through fear of punishment for their base conduct in the battle. But the latter, as though some god had brought them to repentance, were ashamed of their baseness, and as <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> chided them gently and granted them pardon, they became still more angry with themselves and by a surprising revulsion of sentiment demanded that they should be decimated according to the traditional rule. When <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> did not agree to this they were still more ashamed, and acknowledged that they had done him a wrong which he had little deserved at their hands. They cried out that he should at least put the standard-bearers to death because they themselves would never have run away unless the standards had first been turned backwards in flight. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> would not consent even to this, but he reluctantly punished a few. So great was the zeal excited among all by his moderation that they demanded to be led against the enemy immediately. They urged him vehemently, encouraging him and promising to wipe out their disgrace by a splendid victory. Of their own accord they visited each other in military order and took an oath by companies, under the eye of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself, that they would not leave the land of battle except as victors.20

64 1 <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s friends, therefore, urged him to avail himself of the army's repentance and eagerness promptly, but he said in the hearing of the host that he would take a better opportunity to lead them against the enemy, and he exhorted them to be mindful of their present zeal. He privately admonished his friends that it was necessary first for the soldiers to recover from the very great alarm of their recent defeat, and for the enemy to lose something of their present high confidence. He confessed also that he had made a mistake in encamping before Dyrrachium where <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> had abundance of supplies, whereas he ought to have drawn him to some place where he would be subject to the same scarcity as themselves.

After saying this he marched directly to Apollonia and from there to Thessaly, advancing by night in order to conceal his movements. The small town of Gomphi, to which he came, refused to open its gates to him, and he took it by storm and gave it over to his army to plunder. The soldiers, who had suffered much from hunger, ate immoderately and drank wine to excess, the Germans among them being especially ridiculous under the influence of drink, so that it seems probable that <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> might have attacked them then and gained another victory had he not disdainfully neglected a close pursuit. After seven days of rapid marching <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> encamped near Pharsalus. It is said that among the notable calamities of Gomphi, the bodies of twenty venerable men of the first rank were found lying on the floor in an apothecary's shop, not wounded, and with goblets near them, as though they were drunk, but that one of them was seated in a chair like a physician, and had no doubt dealt out poison to them.

65 1 After <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had withdrawn <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> called a council of war, at which <persName n="8">Afranius</persName> advised that they should make use of their naval force, in which they were much superior, and being masters of the sea should harass <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, who was now wandering and destitute, and that <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> himself should conduct his infantry with all haste to Italy, which was well disposed toward him and was now free from a hostile army. Having mastered it, together with Gaul and Spain, they could attack <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> again from their own home, the seat of imperial power. Although this was the best possible advice <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> disregarded it and allowed himself to be persuaded by those who said that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s army would presently desert to him on account of hunger, or that there would not be much left of it anyway after the victory of Dyrrachium. They said it would be disgraceful to abandon the pursuit of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> when he was in flight, and for the victor to flee as though vanquished. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> sided with these advisers partly out of regard for the opinions of the eastern nations that were looking on, partly to prevent any harm befalling <persName n="307">Lucius Scipio</persName>, who was still in Macedonia, but most of all because he thought that he ought to benefit while his army was in high spirits. Accordingly he advanced and pitched his camp opposite to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s near Pharsalus, so that they were separated from each other by a distance of thirty stades.

66 1 <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s supplies came from every quarter, for the roads, harbours, and strongholds had been so provided beforehand that food was brought to him at all times from the land, and every wind blew it to him from the sea. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, on the other hand, had only what he could find with difficulty and seize by hard labour. Yet even so nobody deserted him, but all, by a kind of divine fury, longed to come to close quarters with the enemy. They considered that they, who had been trained in arms for ten years, were much superior to the new levies of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> in fighting, but that for digging ditches and building fortifications and for laborious foraging they were weaker by reason of their age. Tired as they were they altogether preferred to perform some deed of valour21 rather than perish by hunger or inaction. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> perceived this and considered it dangerous to risk everything on a single battle with disciplined and desperate men, and against the brilliant good fortune of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. It would be easier and safer to reduce them by want as they controlled no fertile territory, and could get nothing by sea, and had no ships for rapid flight.

So on the most prudent calculation he decided to protract the war and drive the enemy from famine to plague, 67 1 but he was surrounded by a great number of senators, of equal rank with himself, by very distinguished knights, and by many kings and princes. Some of these, by reason of their inexperience in war, others because they were too much elated by the victory at Dyrrachium, others because they outnumbered the enemy, and others because they were quite tired of the war and preferred a quick decision rather than a sound one — all urged him to fight, pointing out to him that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was always drawn up for battle and challenging him. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> endeavoured to shew them from this very fact that just as <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was compelled to do so by his want of supplies, so they had the more reason to remain quiet because <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was being driven on by necessity. Yet, harassed by the whole army, which was unduly puffed up by the victories at Dyrrachium, and by men of rank who accused him of being fond of power and of delaying purposely in order to prolong his authority over so many men of his own rank — and who for this reason called him derisively "king of kings" and "Agamemnon," because he also ruled over kings while the war lasted — he allowed himself to be moved from his own purpose and gave in to them, being even now under that same divine infatuation which led him astray during the whole of this war. He had now become, contrary to his nature, sluggish and dilatory in all things, and he prepared for battle against his will, to his own hurt and that of the men who had persuaded him.

68 1 That same night three of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s legions started out to forage; for <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself approved <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s dilatory proceedings, and had no idea that he would change, and accordingly sent them out to procure food. When he perceived that the enemy was preparing to fight he was delighted at the pressure which he conjectured had been put upon <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> by his army, and he recalled all of his forces at once and made preparations on his own side. He offered sacrifice at midnight and invoked Mars and his own ancestress, Venus (for it was believed that from Aeneas and his son, Ilus, was descended the xxxxx race, with a slight change of name), and he vowed that he would build a temple in Rome as a thank-offering to her as the Bringer of Victory if everything went well. Thereupon a flame from heaven flew through the air from <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s camp to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s, where it was extinguished. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s men said that it signified a brilliant victory for them over their enemies, but <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> interpreted it as meaning that he should fall upon and extinguish the power of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. When <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> was sacrificing the same night some of the victims escaped and could not be caught, and a swarm of bees, torpid creatures, settled on the altar. Shortly before daylight a panic occurred in his army. He himself went around and quieted it and then fell into a deep sleep, and when his friends aroused him he said that he had just dreamed that he had dedicated a temple in Rome to Venus the Bringer of Victory.

69 1 His friends and his whole army when they heard of this were delighted, being in ignorance of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s vow, and in other respects too, going to the battle in an unreasoning, a reckless, and contemptuous way as though it were already won. Many of them adorned their tents with laurel branches, the insignia of victory, and their slaves prepared a magnificent banquet for them. Some, too, of them began already to contend with each other for <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s office of Pontifex Maximus. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, being experienced in military affairs, turned away from these follies with concealed indignation, but he remained altogether silent through hesitancy and dread, as though he were no longer commander but under command, and as though he were doing everything under compulsion and against his judgment; so deep the dejection which had come over this man of great deeds (who, until this day, had been most fortunate in every undertaking), either because he had not carried his point in deciding what was the best course, and was about to cast the die involving the lives of so many men and also involving his own reputation as invincible; or because some presentiment of approaching evil troubled him, presaging his complete downfall that very day from a position of such vast power. Remarking merely to his friends that whichever should conquer, that day would be the beginning of great evils to the Romans for all future time, he began to make arrangements for the battle. In this remark some people thought his real intentions escaped him, involuntarily expressed in a moment of fear, and they inferred that even if <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> had been victorious he would not have laid down the supreme power.

70 1 Since many writers differ as to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s army, I shall follow the most credible Roman authorities, who give the most careful enumeration of the Italian soldiers, as the backbone of the army, but do not make much account of the allied forces or record them exactly, regarding them as mere foreigners and as contributing little to the issue of the day. The army, then, consisted of about 22,000 men and of these about 1000 were cavalry. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> had more than double that number, of whom about 7000 were cavalry. Some of the most trustworthy writers say that 70,000 Italian soldiers were engaged in this battle. Others give the smaller number, 60,000. Still others, grossly exaggerating, say 400,000. Of the whole number some say <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s forces were half as many again as <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s, others that they were two-thirds of the total number engaged. So much doubt is there as to the exact truth. However that may be, each of them placed his chief reliance on his Italian troops. In the way of allied forces <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had cavalry from both Cisalpine23 and Transalpine Gaul, besides some light-armed Greeks, consisting of Dolopians, Acarnanians, and Aetolians. Such were <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s allies. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> had a great number from all the eastern nations, part horse, part foot. From Greece he had Lacedaemonians marshalled by their own kings, and others from Peloponnesus and Boeotians with them. Athenians marched to his aid also, although proclamation had been made that they, being consecrated to the Thesmophori, should do no harm to the army of either party. Nevertheless, they wished to share in the glory of the war because this was a contest for the Roman leadership.

71 1 Besides the Greeks almost all the nations of the Levant sent aid to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>: Thracians, Hellespontines, Bithynians, Phrygians, Ionians, Lydians, Pamphylians, Pisidians, Paphlagonians; Cilicia, Syria, Phoenicia, the Hebrews, and their neighbours the Arabs; Cyprians, Rhodians, Cretan slingers, and all the other islanders. Kings and princes were there leading their own troops: <persName n="147">Deiotarus, the tetrarch of Galatia,</persName> and <persName n="43">Ariarathes, king of Cappadocia</persName>. <persName n="554">Taxiles</persName> commanded the Armenians from the hither side of the Euphrates; those from the other side were led by <persName n="352">Megabates</persName>, the lieutenant of <persName n="52">King Artapates</persName>. Some other small princes took part with <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> in the action. It was said that sixty ships from Egypt were contributed to him by the sovereigns of that country, <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName> and her brother <persName n="440">Ptolemy XIII</persName>, who was still a boy. But these did not take part in the battle, nor did any other naval force, but they remained idle at Corcyra. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> seems to have acted very foolishly in this respect both in disregarding the fleet, in which he excelled so greatly that he could have deprived the enemy of all the supplies brought to them from abroad, and in risking a battle on land with men exulting in their recent labours, and thirsting like tigers for blood. Although he had been on his guard against them at Dyrrachium, a certain spell seems to have come over him, most opportunely for <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, with the result that <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s army became light-headed to a degree, taking entire charge of its commander, and rushing into action in a most unworkmanlike way.

72 1 Such was the ordering of divine Providence to usher in the universal imperial power of our own day. Each of the commanders assembled his soldiers and made an appeal to them. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> spoke as follows: "You, my fellow soldiers, are the leaders in this task rather than the led, for you urged on this engagement while I was still desirous of wearing <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> out by hunger. Since, therefore, you are the marshalls of the lists of battle, conduct yourself like those who are greatly superior in numbers. Despise the enemy as victors do the vanquished, as young men do the old, as fresh troops do those who are wearied with many toils. Fight like those who have the power and the means, and the consciousness of a good cause. We are contending for liberty and country. On our side are the laws and honourable fame, and this great number of senators and knights, against one man who is piratically seizing supreme power. Go forward then, as you have desired to do, with good hope, keeping in your mind's eye the flight of the enemy at Dyrrachium, and the great number of their standards that we captured in one day when we defeated them there."

73 1 Such was <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s speech. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> addressed his men as follows: "My friends, we have already overcome our more formidable enemies, and are about to encounter not hunger and want, but men. This day will decide everything. Remember what you promised me at Dyrrachium. Remember how you swore to each other in my presence that you would never leave the field except as conquerors. These men, fellow-soldiers, are the same that we have come to meet from the Pillars of Hercules, the same men who gave us the slip from Italy. They are the same who sought to disband us without honours, without a triumph, without rewards, after the toils and struggles of ten years, after we had finished those great wars, after innumerable victories, and after we had added 400 nations in Spain, Gaul, and Britain to our country's sway. I have not been able to prevail upon them by offering fair terms, nor to win them by benefits. Some, you know, I dismissed unharmed, hoping that we should obtain some justice from them. Recall all these facts to your minds to‑day, and if you have any experience of me recall also my care for you, my good faith, and the generosity of my gifts to you.

74 1 Nor is it difficult for hardy and veteran soldiers to overcome new recruits who are without experience in war, and who, moreover, like boys, spurn the rules of discipline and of obedience to their commander. I learn that he was afraid and unwilling to come to an engagement. His star has already passed his zenith; he has become slow and hesitating in all his acts, and no longer commands, but obeys the orders of others. I say these things of his Italian forces only. As for his allies, do not think about them, pay no attention to them, do not fight with them at all. They are Syrian, Phrygian, and Lydian slaves, always ready for flight or servitude. I know very well, and you will presently see, that <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> himself will not entrust to them any place in the ranks of war. Give your attention to the Italians only, even though those allies come running around you like dogs trying to frighten you. When you have put the enemy to flight let us spare the Italians as being our own kindred, but slaughter the allies in order to strike terror into the others. Before all else, in order that I may know that you are mindful of your promise to choose victory or death, throw down the walls of your camp as you go out to battle and fill up the ditch, so that we may have no place of refuge if we do not conquer, and so that the enemy may see that we have no camp and know that we are compelled to encamp in theirs."

75 1 Nevertheless, after he had thus spoken <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> detailed 2,000 of his oldest men to guard the tents. The rest, as they passed out, demolished their fortification in the profoundest silence and filled up the ditch with the debris. When <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> saw this, although some of his friends thought that it was a preparation for flight, he knew it was an exhibition of daring, and groaned in spirit, to think that they were now coming to grips with wild beasts although they had on their side famine, the best tamer of wild beasts. But there was no drawing back now, when things were balanced on the razor's edge. Wherefore, leaving 4,000 of his Italian troops to guard his camp, <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> drew up the remainder between the city of Pharsalus and the river Enipeus opposite the place where <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was marshalling his forces. Each of them ranged his Italians in front, divided into three lines with a moderate space between them, and placed his cavalry on the wings of each division. Archers and slingers were mingled among all. Thus were the Italian troops disposed, on which each commander placed his chief reliance. The allied forces were marshalled by themselves rather for show than for use. There was much jargon and confusion of tongues among <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s auxiliaries. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> stationed the Macedonians, Peloponnesians, Boeotians, and Athenians near the Italian legions, as he approved of their good order and quiet behaviour. The rest, as <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had anticipated, he ordered to lie in wait by tribes outside of the line of battle, and when the engagement should become close to surround the enemy, to pursue, to do what damage they could, and to plunder <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s camp, which was without defences.

76 1 The centre of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s formation was commanded by his father-in‑law, Scipio, the left wing by <persName n="293">Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>, and the right by <persName n="260">Lentulus Crus</persName>. <persName n="8">Afranius</persName> and <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> guarded the camp. On <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s side the commanders were <persName n="455">Publius Sulla</persName>, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and <persName n="215">Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus</persName>. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> took his place in the tenth legion, on the right wing, as was his custom. When the enemy saw this they transferred, to face that legion, the best of their horse, in order to surround it if they could, by their superiority of numbers. When <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> perceived this movement he placed 3,000 of his bravest foot-soldiers in ambush and ordered them, when they should see the enemy trying to flank him, to rise, dart forward, and thrust their spears directly in the faces of the men because, as they were fresh and inexperienced and still in the bloom of youth, they would not endure injury to their faces. Thus they laid their plans against each other, and each commander passed through the ranks of his own troops, attending to what was needful, exhorting his men to courage, and giving them the watchword, which on <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s side was "Venus the Victorious," and on <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s "Hercules the Invincible."

77 1 When all was in readiness on both sides they waited for some time in profound silence, hesitating, looking steadfastly at each other, each expecting the other to begin the battle. They were stricken with sorrow for the great host, for never before had such large Italian armies confronted the same danger together. They had pity for the valour of these men (the flower of both parties), especially because they saw Italians embattled against Italians. As the danger became nearer, the ambition that had inflamed and blinded them was extinguished, and gave place to fear. Reason purged the mad passion for glory, estimated the peril, and laid bare the cause of the war, showing how two men contending with each other for supremacy were throwing into the scale their own lives and fortunes — for defeat would means the lowest degradation — and those of so large a number of the noblest citizens. The leaders reflected also that they, who had lately been friends and relatives by marriage, and had co-operated with each other in many ways to gain rank and power, had now drawn the sword for mutual slaughter and were leading to the same impiety those serving under them, men of the same city, of the same tribe, blood relations, and in some cases brothers against brothers. Even these circumstances were not wanting in this battle; because many unnatural things must happen when thousands of the same nation come together in the clash of arms. Reflecting on these things each of them was seized with unavailing repentance, and since this day was to decide for each whether he should be the highest or the lowest of the human race, they hesitated to begin so critical a battle. It is said that both of them even wept.

78 1 When they were waiting and looking at each other the day was advancing. All the Italian troops stood motionless in their places, but when <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> saw that his allied forces were falling into confusion by reason of the delay he feared lest the disorder should spread from them before the beginning of the battle. So he sounded the signal first and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> echoed it back. Straightway the trumpets, of which there were many distributed among the divisions of so great a host, aroused the soldiers with their inspiring blasts, and the standard-bearers and officers put themselves in motion and exhorted their men. They all advanced confidently to the encounter, but with stupor and the deepest silence, like men who had had experience in many similar engagements. And now, as they came nearer together, there was first a discharge of arrows and stones. Then, as the cavalry were a little in advance of the infantry, they charged each other. Those of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> prevailed and began to outflank the tenth legion. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> then gave the signal to the cohorts in ambush and these, starting up suddenly, advanced to meet the cavalry, and with spears elevated aimed at the faces of the riders, who could not endure the enemy's savagery, nor the blows on their mouths and eyes, but fled in disorder. Thereupon <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s men,26 who had just now been afraid of being surrounded, fell upon the flank of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s infantry which was denuded of its cavalry supports.

79 1 When <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> learned this he ordered his infantry not to advance farther, not to break the line of formation, and not to hurl the javelin, but to open their ranks, bring their spears to rest, and so ward off the onset of the enemy. Some persons praise this order of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> as the best in a case where one is attacked in flank, but <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> criticises it in his letters. He says that the blows are delivered with more force, and that the spirits of the men are raised, by running, while those who stand still lose courage by reason of their immobility and become excellent targets for those charging against them. So, he says, it proved in this case, for the tenth legion, with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself, surrounded <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s left wing, now deprived of cavalry, and assailed it with javelins in flank, where it stood immovable; until, finally, the assailants threw it into disorder, routed it, and this was the beginning of the victory. In the rest of the field slaughter and wounding of all kinds were going on, but no cry came from the scene of carnage, no lamentation from the wounded or the dying, only sighs and groans from those who were falling honourably in their tracks. The allies, who were looking at the battle as at a spectacle, were astonished at the discipline of the combatants. So dumbfounded were they that they did not dare attack <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s tents, although they were guarded only by a few old men. Nor did they accomplish anything else, but stood in a kind of stupor.

80 1 As <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s left wing began to give way his men even still retired step by step and in perfect order, but the allies who had not been in the fight, fled with headlong speed, shouting, "We are vanquished," dashed upon their own tents and fortifications as though they had been the enemy's, and pulled down and plundered whatever they could carry away in their flight. Then the rest of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s Italian legions, perceiving the disaster to the left wing, retired slowly at first, in good order, and still resisting as well as they could; but when the enemy, flushed with victory, pressed upon them they turned in flight. Thereupon <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, in order that they might not rally, and that this might be the end of the whole war and not of one battle merely, with greater prudence than he had ever shown before, sent heralds everywhere among the ranks to order the victors to spare their own countrymen and to smite only the auxiliaries. The heralds drew near to the retreating enemy and told them to stand still and fear not. As this proclamation was passed from man to man they halted, and the phrase "stand and fear not" began to be passed as a sort of watchword among <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s soldiers; for, being Italians, they were clad in the same style as <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s men and spoke the same language. Accordingly, the latter passed by them and fell upon the auxiliaries, who were not able to resist, and made a very great slaughter among them.

81 1 When <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> saw the retreat of his men he became bereft of his senses and retired at a slow pace to his camp, and when he reached his tent he sat down speechless, resembling Ajax, the son of Telamon, who, they say, suffered in like manner in the midst of his enemies at Troy, being deprived of his senses by some god. Very few of the rest returned to the camp, for <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s proclamation caused them to remain unharmed, and as their enemies had passed beyond them they dispersed in groups. As the day was declining <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> ran hither and thither among his troops and besought them to continue their exertions till they should capture <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s camp, telling them that if they allowed the enemy to rally they would be the victors for only a single day, whereas if they should take the enemy's camp they would finish the war with this one blow. He stretched out his hands to them and took the lead in person. Although they were weary in body, the words and example of their commander lightened their spirits. Their success so far, and the hope of capturing the enemy's camp and the contents thereof, excited them; for in the midst of hope and prosperity men feel fatigue least. So they fell upon the camp and assaulted it with the utmost disdain for the defenders. When <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> learned this he started up from his strange silence, exclaiming, "What! in our very camp?" Having spoken thus he changed his clothing, mounted a horse, and fled with four friends, and did not draw rein until he reached Larissa early the next morning. So <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> established himself in <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s camp as he had promised to do when he was preparing for the battle, and ate <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s supper, and the whole army feasted at the enemy's expense.

82 1 The losses of Italians on each side — for there was no report of the losses of auxiliaries, either because of their multitude or because they were despised — were as follows: in <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s army, thirty centurions and 200 legionaries, or, as some authorities have it, 1200; on <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s side ten senators, among whom was <persName n="293">Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>, the same who had been sent to succeed <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself in Gaul, and about forty distinguished knights. Some exaggerating writers put the loss in the remainder of his forces at 25,000, but <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName>, who was one of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s officers in this battle, records the number of dead Pompeians found as 6000.

Such was the result of the famous battle of Pharsalus. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself carries off the palm for first and second place by common consent, and with him the tenth legion. The third place is taken by the centurion <persName n="132">Crassinius</persName>, whom <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> asked at the beginning of the battle what result he anticipated, and who responded proudly, "We shall conquer, O <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and you will thank me either living or dead." The whole army testifies that he darted through the ranks like one possessed and did many brilliant deeds. When sought for he was found among the dead, and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> bestowed military honours on his body and buried it, and erected a special tomb for him near the common burial-place of the others.

83 1 From Larissa <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> continued his flight to the sea where he embarked in a small boat, and meeting a ship by chance he sailed to Mitylene. There he joined his wife, <persName n="122">Cornelia</persName> and they embarked with four triremes which had come to him from Rhodes and Tyre. He decided not to sail for Corcyra and Africa, where he had other large military and naval forces as yet untouched, but intended to push on eastward to the king of the Parthians, expecting to receive every assistance from him. He concealed his intention until he arrived at Cilicia, where he revealed it hesitatingly to his friends; but they advised him to beware of the Parthian, against whom <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> had lately led an expedition, and who was puffed up by his victory over the latter, and especially not to put in the power of these barbarians the beautiful <persName n="122">Cornelia</persName>, who had formerly been the wife of <persName n="133">Crassus</persName>.27 Then he made a second proposal respecting Egypt and <persName n="242">Juba</persName>.28 The latter they despised as not sufficiently distinguished, but they all agreed about going to Egypt, which was near and was a great kingdom, still prosperous and powerful in ships, provisions, and money. Its sovereigns, too, although children, were allied to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> by their father's friendship.

84 1 For these reasons he sailed to Egypt, whence <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName>, who had previously reigned with her brother, had been lately expelled, and was collecting an army in Syria. <persName n="440">Ptolemy XIII</persName>, her brother, was at Casium in Egypt, lying in wait for her invasion, and, as Providence would have it, the wind carried <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> thither. Seeing a large army on the shore he stopped his ship, rightly judging that the king was there. So he sent messengers to tell of his arrival and to speak of his father's friendship. The king was then about thirteen years of age and was under the tutelage of <persName n="1">Achillas</persName>, who commanded his army, and the eunuch <persName n="434">Pothinus</persName>, who had charge of his treasury. These took counsel together concerning <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. There was present also <persName n="558">Theodotus</persName>, a rhetorician of Samos, the boy's tutor, who offered the infamous advice that they should lay a trap for <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and kill him in order to curry favour with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. His opinion prevailed. So they sent a miserable skiff to bring him, pretending that the sea was shallow and not adapted to large ships. Some of the king's attendants came in the skiff, among them a Roman, named <persName n="516">Septimius</persName>, who was then serving in the king's army and had formerly served under <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> himself. He gave his hand to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> in the king's name and directed him to take passage in the boat to the young man as to a friend. At the same time the whole army was marshalled along the shore as if to do honour to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, and the king was conspicuous in the midst of them by the purple robe he wore.

85 1 <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s suspicions were aroused by all that he observed — the marshalling of the army, the meanness of the skiff, and the fact that the king himself did not come to meet him nor send any of his high dignitaries. Nevertheless, he entered the skiff, repeating to himself these lines of <persName n="674">Sophocles</persName>, "Whoso resorts to a tyrant becomes his slave, even if he be free when he goes." While rowing to the shore all were silent, and this made him still more suspicious. Finally, either recognizing <persName n="516">Septimius</persName> as a Roman soldier who had served under him or guessing that he was such because he alone remained standing (for, according to military discipline, a soldier does not sit in the presence of his commander), he turned to him and said, "Do I not know you, comrade?" The other nodded and, as <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> turned away, he immediately gave him the first stab and the others followed his example. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s wife and friends who saw this at a distance cried out and, lifting their hands to heaven, invoked the gods, the avengers of violated faith. Then they sailed away in all haste as from an enemy's country.

86 1 The servants of <persName n="434">Pothinus</persName> cut off <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s head and kept it for <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, in expectation of a large reward, but he visited condign punishment on them for their nefarious deed. The remainder of the body was buried by somebody on the shore, and a small monument was erected over it, on which somebody else wrote this inscription:—

"How pitiful a tomb for one so rich in temples."31

In the course of time the monument was wholly covered with sand and the bronze images that had been erected to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> by his kinsfolk at a later period near Mount xxxxx had all been outraged and afterwards removed to the secret recess of the temple, but in my time they were sought for and found by the Roman emperor <persName n="224">Hadrian</persName>, while making a journey thither, who cleared away the rubbish from the monument and made it again conspicuous, and placed <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s images in their proper places.

Such was the end of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, who had successfully carried on the greatest wars and had made the greatest additions to the empire of the Romans, and had acquired by that means the title of great. He had never been defeated before,32 but had remained unvanquished and most fortunate from his youth up. From his twenty-third to his fifty-eighth year he had not ceased to exercise power which as regards its strength was that of an autocrat, but by the inevitable contrast with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had an almost democratic appearance.33

87 1 <persName n="363">Metellus Scipio</persName>, <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s father-in‑law, and the other notables who had escaped from the battle of Pharsalus, more prudent than <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, hurried to Corcyra and joined <persName n="104">Cato</persName>, who had been left there with another army and 300 triremes. The leaders apportioned the fleet among themselves, and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> sailed to <persName n="407">Pharnaces</persName> in Pontus to induce him to take up arms against <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. <persName n="363">Metellus Scipio</persName> and <persName n="104">Cato</persName> embarked for Africa, relying on <persName n="589">Varus</persName> and his army and his ally, <persName n="242">Juba</persName>, king of Numidia. The elder son of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, <persName n="221">Gnaeus Pompey</persName>, together with <persName n="251">Labienus</persName> and <persName n="507">Scapula</persName>, each with his own part of the army, hastened to Spain and, having detached it from <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, collected a new army of Spaniards, Celtiberians, and slaves, and made formidable preparations for war. So great were the forces still remaining which <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> had prepared, and which <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> himself overlooked and ran away from in his infatuation. <persName n="104">Cato</persName> had been chosen commander of the forces in Africa, but he declined the appointment since there were consulars present who outranked him, he having held only the praetorship in Rome. So <persName n="363">Metellus Scipio</persName> was made the commander and he collected and drilled a large army there. Thus two armies of considerable magnitude were brought together against <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, one in Africa and the other in Spain.

88 1 <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> remained two days at Pharsalus after the victory, offering sacrifice and giving his army a respite from fighting. Then he set free his Thessalian allies and granted pardon to the suppliant Athenians, and said to them, "How often will the glory of your ancestors save you from self-destruction?" On the third day he marched eastward, having learned that <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> had fled thither, and for want of triremes he essayed to cross the Hellespont in skiffs. Here <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> came upon him in midstream, with a part of his fleet, as he was hastening to <persName n="407">Pharnaces</persName>. Although he might have mastered these small boats with his numerous triremes he was panic-stricken by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s astounding success, which was then heralded with consternation everywhere, and he thought that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had sailed purposely against him. So he extended his hands in entreaty from his trireme toward the skiff, begged for pardon, and surrendered his fleet. I can see no other reason myself, nor can I think of any other instance where fortune was more propitious in a trying emergency than when <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, a most valiant man, with seventy triremes, fell in with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> when he was unprepared, but did not venture to come to blows with him. And yet he who thus, through fear alone, disgracefully surrendered to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> when he was crossing the straits, afterward murdered him in Rome when he was at the height of his power; by which fact it is evident that the panic which then seized <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> was due to the fortune by which <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was uplifted.34

89 1 Being thus unexpectedly saved, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> passed the Hellespont and granted pardon to the Ionians, the Aeolians, and the other peoples who inhabit the great peninsula called by the common name of Lower Asia, and who sent ambassadors to him to ask it. Learning that <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> was making for Egypt he sailed for Rhodes. He did not wait even there for his army, which was coming forward by detachments, but embarked with those he had on the triremes of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and the Rhodians. Letting nobody know whither he intended to go he set sail toward evening, telling the other pilots to steer by the torch of his own ship by night and by his signal in the daytime; his own pilot, after they had proceeded a long way from the land, he ordered to steer for Alexandria. After a three days' sail he arrived there, and was received by the king's guardians, the king himself being still at Casium. At first, on account of the smallness of his forces, he pretended to take his ease, receiving visitors in a friendly way, traversing the city, admiring its beauty, and listening to the lectures of the philosophers while he stood among the crowd. Thus he gained the good-will and esteem of the Alexandrians as one who had no designs against them.

90 1 When his soldiers arrived by sea he punished <persName n="434">Pothinus</persName> and <persName n="1">Achillas</persName> with death for their crime against <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. (<persName n="558">Theodotus</persName> escaped and was afterwards crucified by <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, who found him wandering in Asia.) The Alexandrians thereupon rose in tumult, and the king's army marched against <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and various battles took place around the palace and on the neighbouring shores. In one of these <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> escaped by leaping into the sea and swimming a long distance in deep water. The Alexandrians captured his cloak and hung it up as a trophy. He fought the last battle against the king on the banks of the Nile, in which he won a decisive victory. He consumed nine months in this strife, at the end of which he established <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName> on the throne of Egypt in place of her brother. He ascended the Nile with 400 ships, exploring the country in company with <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName> and generally enjoying himself with her. The details, however, of these events are related more particularly in my Egyptian history. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> could not bear to look at the head of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> when it was brought to him, but ordered that it be buried, and set apart for it a small plot of ground near the city which was dedicated to Nemesis, but in my time, while the Roman emperor Trajan was exterminating the Jewish race in Egypt, it was devastated by them in the exigencies of the war.

91 1 After <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had performed these exploits in Alexandria he hastened by way of Syria against <persName n="407">Pharnaces</persName>. The latter had already accomplished many of his aims, had fought a battle with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s lieutenant, <persName n="215">Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus</persName>, and won a very brilliant victory over him. Being much elated by this affair he had subjugated the city of Amisus in Pontus, which adhered to the Roman interest, sold their inhabitants into slavery, and made all their boys eunuchs. On the approach of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> he became alarmed and repented of his deeds, and when <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was within 200 stades he sent ambassadors to him to treat for peace. They bore a golden crown and foolishly offered him the daughter of <persName n="407">Pharnaces</persName> in marriage. When <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> learned what they were bringing he moved forward with his army, walking in advance and chatting with the ambassadors until he arrived at the camp of <persName n="407">Pharnaces</persName>, when he merely said, "Why should I not take instant vengeance on this parricide?" Then he sprang upon his horse and at the first shout put <persName n="407">Pharnaces</persName> to flight and killed a large number of the enemy, although he had with him only about 100 of his own cavalry who had accompanied him in the advance. Here it is said that he exclaimed, "O fortunate <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, who wast considered and named the Great for warring against such men as these in the time of <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName>, the father of this man." Of this battle he wrote to Rome the words, "I came, I saw, I conquered."

92 1 After this, <persName n="407">Pharnaces</persName> was glad to escape to the kingdom which <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> had assigned to him on the Bosporus. As <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had no time to waste on small matters while such great wars were still unfinished elsewhere, he returned to the province of Asia and while passing through it transacted public business in the cities, which were oppressed by the farmers of the revenue, as I have shown in my Asiatic history.35 Learning that a sedition had broken out in Rome and that <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, his master of horse, had occupied the forum with soldiers, he laid aside everything else and hastened to the city. When he arrived there the civil sedition had been quieted, but another one sprang up against himself in the army because the promises made to them after the battle of Pharsalus had not been kept, and because they had been held in service beyond the term fixed by law. They demanded that they should all be dismissed to their homes. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had made them certain indefinite promises at Pharsalus, and others equally indefinite after the war in Africa should be finished. Now he sent them a definite promise of 1000 drachmas more to each man. They answered him that they did not want any more promises but prompt payment in full, and <persName n="500">Sallust</persName>, who had been sent to them on this business, had a narrow escape, for he would have been killed if he had not fled. When <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> learned of this he stationed the legion with which <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had been guarding the city around his own house and the city gates, as he apprehended attempts at plunder. Then, notwithstanding all his friends were alarmed and cautioned him against the fury of the soldiers, he went boldly among them while they were still riotous in the Campus Martius, without sending word beforehand, and showed himself on the platform.

93 1 The soldiers ran together tumultuously without arms, and, as was their custom, saluted their commander who had suddenly appeared among them. When he bade them tell what they wanted they were so surprised that they did not even venture to speak openly of the donative in his presence, but they adopted the more moderate course of demanding their discharge from the service, hoping that, since he needed soldiers for the unfinished wars, he would speak about the donative himself. But, contrary to the expectation of all, he replied without hesitation, "I discharge you." Then, to their still greater astonishment, and while the silence was most profound, he added, "And I shall give you all that I have promised when I triumph with other soldiers." At this expression, as unexpected as it was kind, shame immediately took possession of all, and the consideration, mingled with jealousy, that while they would be thought to be abandoning their commander in the midst of so many enemies, others would join in the triumph instead of themselves, and they would lose the gains of the war in Africa, which were expected to be great, and become hateful to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself as well as to the opposite party. Moved by these fears they remained still more silent and embarrassed, hoping that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> would yield and change his mind on account of his immediate necessity. But he remained silent also, until his friends urged him to say something more to them and not leave his old comrades of so many campaigns with a short and austere word. Then he began to speak, addressing them first as "citizens," not "fellow-soldiers," which implied that they were already discharged from the army and were private individuals.

94 1 They could endure it no longer, but cried out that they repented of what they had done, and besought him to keep them in his service. But <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> turned away and was leaving the platform when they shouted with greater eagerness and urged him to stay and punish the guilty among them. He delayed a while longer, not going away and not turning back, but pretending to be undecided. At length he came back and said that he would not punish any of them, but that he was grieved that even the tenth legion, to which he had always given the first place of honour, should join in such a riot. "And this legion alone," he continued, "I will discharge from the service. Nevertheless, when I return from Africa I will give them all that I have promised. And when the wars are ended I will give lands to all, not as <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> did by taking it from the present holders and uniting present and past owners in a colony, and so making them everlasting enemies to each other, but I will give the public land, and my own, and will purchase as well the necessary implements." There was clapping of hands and joyful acclaim on all sides, but the tenth legion was plunged in grief because to them alone <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> appeared inexorable. They begged him to choose a portion of their number by lot and put them to death. But <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, seeing that there was no need of stimulating them any further when they had repented so bitterly, became reconciled to all, and departed straightway for the war in Africa.

95 1 <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> crossed the strait from Rhegium to Messana and went to Lilybaeum. Here, learning that <persName n="104">Cato</persName> was guarding the enemy's magazines with a fleet and a part of the land forces at Utica, and that he had with him the 300 men who had for a long time constituted their council of war and were called the Senate, and that the commander, <persName n="363">Metellus Scipio</persName>, and the flower of the army were at Adrumetum, he sailed against the latter. He arrived at a time when <persName n="363">Metellus Scipio</persName> had gone away to meet <persName n="242">Juba</persName>, and he drew up his forces for battle near <persName n="363">Metellus Scipio</persName>'s very camp in order to come to an engagement with the enemy at a time when their commander was absent. <persName n="251">Labienus</persName> and <persName n="405">Petreius</persName>, Scipio's lieutenants, attacked him, defeated him badly, and pursued him in a haughty and disdainful manner until <persName n="251">Labienus</persName>'s horse was wounded in the belly and threw him, and his attendants carried him off, and <persName n="405">Petreius</persName>, thinking that he had made a thorough test of the army and that he could conquer whenever he liked, drew off his forces, saying to those around him, "Let us not deprive our general, <persName n="363">Metellus Scipio</persName>, of the victory." In the rest of the battle37 it appeared to be a matter of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s luck that the victorious enemy abandoned the field when they might have won; but it is said that in the flight <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> dashed up to his whole line38 and turned it back and seizing one of those who carried the principal standards (the eagles) dragged him to the front. Finally, <persName n="405">Petreius</persName> retired and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was glad to do the same.

Such was the result of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s first battle in Africa. 96 1 Not long afterward it was reported that <persName n="363">Metellus Scipio</persName> himself was advancing with eight legions of foot, 20,000 horse (of which most were Africans), and a large number of light-armed troops, and thirty elephants; together with King <persName n="242">Juba</persName>, who had some 30,000 foot-soldiers in addition, raised for this war, and 20,000 Numidian cavalry, besides a large number of spearmen and sixty elephants. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s army began to be alarmed and a tumult broke out among them on account of the disaster they had already experienced and of the reputation of the forces advancing against them, and especially of the numbers and bravery of the Numidian cavalry. War with elephants, to which they were unaccustomed, also frightened them. But <persName n="733">Bocchus</persName>, another Mauritanian prince, seized Cirta, which was the capital of <persName n="242">Juba</persName>'s kingdom, and when this news reached <persName n="242">Juba</persName> he started for home at once with his army, leaving thirty of his elephants only with <persName n="363">Metellus Scipio</persName>. Thereupon <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s men plucked up courage to such a degree that the fifth legion begged to be drawn up opposite the elephants, and it overcame them valiantly. From that day to the present this legion has borne the figure of an elephant on its standards.

97 1 The battle was long, severe, and doubtful in all parts of the field until toward evening, when victory declared itself on the side of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, who went straight on and captured <persName n="363">Metellus Scipio</persName>'s camp and did not desist, even in the night, from reaping the fruits of his victory until he had made a clean sweep. The enemy scattered in small bodies wherever they could. <persName n="363">Metellus Scipio</persName> himself, abandoning everything to <persName n="8">Afranius</persName>, fled by sea with twelve open ships.

Thus was this army also, composed of nearly 80,000 men who had been under long training and were inspired with hope and courage by the previous battle, completely annihilated in the second engagement. And now <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s fame began to be celebrated as of a man of invincible fortune, and those who were vanquished by him attributed nothing to his merit, but ascribed everything, including their own blunders, to "<persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s fortune." For in fact it seemed that it was through the bad generalship of the commanders who, as in Thessaly, neglected their opportunity to wear out <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> by delay until his supplies were exhausted, in this foreign land, and in like manner failed to reap the fruits of their first victory, that this war was also foreshortened and thus sharply brought to a finish.

98 1 When these facts became known at Utica some three days later, and as <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was marching right against that place, a general flight began. <persName n="104">Cato</persName> did not detain anybody. He gave ships to all the nobility who asked for them, but himself adhered firmly to his post. When the inhabitants of Utica promised to intercede for him before doing so for themselves, he answered with a smile that he did not need any intercessors with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> knew it very well. Then he placed his seal on all the public property and gave the accounts of each kind to the magistrates of Utica. Toward evening he bathed and dined. He ate in a sitting posture,39 as had been his custom since <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s death. He changed his habits in no respect. He partook of the dinner, neither more nor less than usual. He conversed with the others present concerning those who had sailed away and inquired whether the wind was favourable and whether they would make sufficient distance before <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> should arrive the next morning. Nor did he alter any of his habits when he retired to rest, except that he embraced his son rather more affectionately than usual. As he did not find his dirk in its accustomed place by his couch, he exclaimed that he had been betrayed by his servants to the enemy. "What weapon," he asked, "shall I use if I am attacked in the night?" When they besought him to do no violence to himself but to go to sleep without his dirk, he replied still more plausibly, "Could I not strangle myself with my clothing if I wished to, or knock my brains out against the wall, or throw myself headlong to the ground, or destroy myself by holding my breath?" Much more he said to the same purport until he persuaded them to bring back his dirk. When it had been put in its place he called for <persName n="415">Plato</persName>'s treatise on the soul and began to read.

99 1 When <persName n="415">Plato</persName>'s dialogue had come to an end and when he thought that those who were stationed at the doors were asleep, he stabbed himself under the breast. His intestines protruded and the attendants heard a groan and rushed in. Physicians replaced his intestines, which were still uninjured, in his body, and after sewing up the wound tied a bandage around it. When <persName n="104">Cato</persName> came to himself he dissembled again. Although he blamed himself for the insufficiency of the wound, he expressed thanks to those who had saved him and said that he only needed sleep. The attendants then retired, taking the dirk with them, and closed the door, thinking that he had become quiet. <persName n="104">Cato</persName> after feigning sleep, tore off the bandage with his hands without making any noise, opened the suture of the wound, enlarged it with his nails like a wild beast, plunged his fingers into his stomach, and tore out his entrails until he died, being then about fifty years of age. He was considered the most steadfast of all men in upholding any opinion that he had once espoused and in adhering to justice, rectitude, and morality, not as a matter of custom merely, but rather from a high-souled philosophy. He had married <persName n="317">Marcia</persName>, the daughter of <persName n="410">Philippus</persName>, as a girl; was extremely fond of her, and she had borne him children. Nevertheless, he gave her to <persName n="238">Hortensius</persName>, one of his friends, — who desired to have children but was married to a childless wife, — until she bore a child to him also, when <persName n="104">Cato</persName> took her back to his own house as though he had merely lent her. Such a man was <persName n="104">Cato</persName>, and the Uticans gave him a magnificent funeral. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> said that <persName n="104">Cato</persName> had grudged him the opportunity for a deed of honour,40 but when <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> pronounced an encomium on him which he styled the <persName n="104">Cato</persName>, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> wrote an answer to it which he called the Anti-Cato.

100 1 <persName n="242">Juba</persName> and <persName n="405">Petreius</persName>, in view of the circumstances, perceiving no chance of flight or safety, slew each other with swords at a banquet. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> made <persName n="242">Juba</persName>'s kingdom tributary to the Romans and appointed <persName n="500">Sallust</persName> its governor. He pardoned the Uticans and <persName n="105">Cato</persName> the son of <persName n="104">Cato</persName>. He captured the daughter of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> together with her two children in Utica and sent them safe to the younger <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. Of the 300 he put to death all that he found.41 <persName n="363">Metellus Scipio</persName>, the general-in‑chief was overtaken by a storm, and met a hostile fleet and bore himself bravely until he was overpowered, when he stabbed himself and leaped into the sea.

101 1 This was the end of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s war in Africa, and when he returned to Rome he had four triumphs together: one for his Gallic wars, in which he had added many great nations to the Roman sway and subdued others that had revolted; one for the Pontic war against <persName n="407">Pharnaces</persName>; one for the war in Africa against the African allies of <persName n="363">Metellus Scipio</persName>, in which the historian <persName n="243">Juba</persName> (the son of King <persName n="242">Juba</persName>), then an infant, was led a captive. Between the Gallic and the Pontic triumphs he introduced a kind of Egyptian triumph, in which he led some captives taken in the naval engagement on the Nile. Although he took care not to inscribe any Roman names in his triumph (as it would have been unseemly in his eyes and base and inauspicious in those of the Roman people to triumph over fellow-citizens), yet all these misfortunes were represented in the processions and the men also by various images and pictures, all except <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, whom alone he did not venture to exhibit, since he was still greatly regretted by all. The people, although restrained by fear, groaned over their domestic ills, especially when they saw the picture of <persName n="363">Metellus Scipio</persName>, the general-in‑chief, wounded in the breast by his own hand, casting himself into the sea, and <persName n="405">Petreius</persName> committing self-destruction at the banquet, and <persName n="104">Cato</persName> torn apart by himself like a wild beast. They applauded the death of <persName n="1">Achillas</persName> and <persName n="434">Pothinus</persName>, and laughed at the flight of <persName n="407">Pharnaces</persName>.

102 1 It is said that money to the amount of 60,500 silver talents42 was borne in the procession and 2822 crowns of gold weighing 20,414 pounds, from which wealth <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> made apportionments immediately after the triumph, paying the army all that he had promised and more. Each soldier received 5000 Attic drachmas, each centurion double, and each tribune of infantry and perfect of cavalry fourfold that sum. To each plebeian citizen also was given an Attic mina. He gave also various spectacles with horses and music, a combat of foot-soldiers, 1000 on each side, and a cavalry fight of 200 on each side. There was also another combat of horse and foot together. There was a combat of elephants, twenty against twenty, and a naval engagement of 4000 oarsmen, where 1000 fighting men contended on each side. He erected the temple to Venus, his ancestress, as he had vowed to do when he was about to begin the battle of Pharsalus, and he laid out ground around the temple which he intended to be a forum for the Roman people, not for buying and selling, but a meeting-place for the transaction of public business, like the public squares of the Persians, where the people assemble to seek justice or to learn the laws. He placed a beautiful image of <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName> by the side of the goddess, which stands there to this day. He caused an enumeration of the people to be made, and it is said that it was found to be only one half of the number existing before this war. To such a degree had the rivalry of these two men reduced the city.

103 1 <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, now in his fourth consulship, marched against the younger <persName n="221">Gnaeus Pompey</persName> in Spain. This was all that was left of the civil war, but it was not to be despised, for such of the nobility as had escaped from Africa had assembled there. The army was composed of soldiers from Pharsalus and Africa itself, who had come hither with their leaders, and of Spaniards and Celtiberians, a strong and warlike race. There was also a great number of emancipated slaves in <persName n="221">Gnaeus Pompey</persName>'s camp, who had all been under discipline four years and were ready to fight with desperation. <persName n="221">Gnaeus Pompey</persName> was misled by this appearance of strength and did not postpone the battle, but engaged <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> straightway on his arrival, although the older men, who had learned by experience at Pharsalus and Africa, advised him to wear <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> out by delay and reduce him to want, as he was in a hostile country. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> made the journey from Rome in twenty-seven days, though he was moving, with a heavily-laden army, by a very long route, but fear fell upon his soldiers as never before, in consequence of the reports received of the numbers, the discipline, and the desperate valour of the enemy.

104 1 For this reason <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself also was slow in movement, until <persName n="221">Gnaeus Pompey</persName> approached him at a certain place where he was reconnoitring and accused him of cowardice. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> could not endure this reproach. He drew up his forces for battle near Corduba, and then, too, gave Venus for his watchword. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, on the other hand, gave Piety for his. When battle was joined fear seized upon <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s army and hesitation was joined to fear. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, lifting his hands toward heaven, implored all the gods that his many glorious deeds be not stained by this single disaster. He ran up and encouraged his soldiers. He took his helmet off his head and shamed them to their faces and exhorted them. As they abated nothing of their fear he seized a shield from a soldier and said to the officers around him, "This shall be the end of my life and of your military service." Then he sprang forward in advance of his line of battle toward the enemy so far that he was only ten feet distant from them. Some 200 missiles were aimed at him, some of which he evaded while others were caught on his shield. Then each of the tribunes ran toward him and took position by his side, and the whole army rushed forward and fought the entire day, advancing and retreating by turns until, toward evening, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> with difficulty won the victory. It was reported that he said that he had often fought for victory, but that this time he had fought even for existence.

105 1 After a great slaughter the Pompeians fled to Corduba, and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, in order to prevent the fugitives from preparing for another battle, ordered a siege of that place. The soldiers, wearied with toil, piled the bodies and arms of the slain together, fastened them to the earth with spears, and encamped behind this ghastly wall. On the following day the city was taken. <persName n="507">Scapula</persName>, one of the Pompeian leaders, erected a funeral pile on which he consumed himself. The heads of <persName n="589">Varus</persName>, <persName n="251">Labienus</persName>, and other distinguished men were brought to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. <persName n="221">Gnaeus Pompey</persName> himself fled from the scene of his defeat with 150 horsemen toward Carteia, where he had a fleet, and entered the dockyard secretly as a private individual borne in a litter. When he saw that the men here despaired of their safety he feared lest he should be delivered up, and took to flight again. While going on board a small boat his foot was caught by a rope, and a man who attempted to cut the rope with his sword cut the sole of his foot instead. So he sailed to a certain place and received medical treatment. Being pursued thither he fled by a rough and thorny road that aggravated his wound, until fagged out he took a seat under a tree. Here his pursuers came upon him and he was cut down while defending himself bravely. His head was brought to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> who gave orders for its burial. Thus this war also, contrary to expectation, was brought to an end in one battle. A younger brother of this <persName n="221">Gnaeus Pompey</persName>, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, collected those who escaped from this fight.

106 1 <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> for the present kept hid and lived by piracy, but <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> having ended the civil wars hastened to Rome, honoured and feared as no one had ever been before. All kinds of honours were devised for his gratification without stint, even such as were divine — sacrifices, games, statues in all the temples and public places, by every tribe, by all the provinces, and by the kings in alliance with Rome. He was represented in different characters, and in some cases crowned with oak as the saviour of his country, for by this crown those whose lives had been saved used formerly to reward those to whom they owed their safety. He was proclaimed the Father of his Country and chosen dictator for life and consul for ten years, and his person was declared sacred and inviolable. It was decreed that he should transact business on a throne of ivory and gold; that he should himself sacrifice always in triumphal costume; that each year the city should celebrate the days on which he had won his victories; that every five years priests and Vestal virgins should offer up public prayers for his safety; and that the magistrates immediately upon their inauguration should take an oath not to oppose any of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s decrees. In honour of his birth the name of the month Quintilis was changed to July. Many temples were decreed to him as to a god, and one was dedicated in common to him and the goddess Clemency, who were represented as clasping hands. Thus whilst they feared his power they besought his clemency.

107 1 There were some who proposed to give him the title of king, but when he learned of their purpose he forbade it with threats, saying that it was an inauspicious name by reason of the curse of their ancestors. He dismissed the praetorian cohorts that had served as his bodyguard during the wars, and showed himself with the ordinary civil escort only. While he was thus transacting business in front of the rostra, the Senate, preceded by the consuls, each one in his robes of office, brought the decree awarding him the honours aforesaid. He extended his hand to them, but did not rise when they approached nor while they remained there, and this, too, afforded his slanderers a pretext for accusing him of wishing to be greeted as a king. He accepted all the honours conferred upon him except the ten-year consulship. As consuls for the ensuing year he designated himself and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, his master of horse, and he appointed <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, who was then governor of Spain, but was administering it by his friends, master of horse in place of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> also recalled the exiles, except those who were banished for some very grave offence. He pardoned his enemies and forthwith added many of those who had fought against him to the yearly magistracies, or to the command of provinces and armies. Wherefore the people was chiefly induced to hope that he would restore the republic to them as <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> did after he had attained the same power.

108 1 In this they were disappointed, but some person among those who wished to spread the report of his desire to be king placed a crown of laurel on his statue, bound with a white fillet. The tribunes, <persName n="156">Epidius Marullus</persName> and <persName n="91">Caesetius Flavus</persName>, sought out this person and put him in prison, pretending to gratify <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> also by this, as he had threatened any who should talk about making him king. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> put up with their action, and when some others who met him at the city gates as he was returning from some place greeted him as king, and the people groaned, he said with happy readiness to those who had thus saluted him, "I am not King, I am <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>," as though they had mistaken his name. The attendants of <persName n="156">Epidius Marullus</persName> again found out which man began the shouting and ordered the officers to bring him to trial before his tribunal. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> at last put up with it no longer and accused the faction of <persName n="156">Epidius Marullus</persName> before the Senate of artfully conspiring to cast upon him the odium of royalty. He added that they were deserving of death, but that it would be sufficient if they were deprived of their office and expelled from the Senate. Thus he confirmed the suspicion that he desired the title, and that his tyranny was already complete; for the cause of their punishment was their zeal against the title of king, and, moreover, the office of tribune was sacred and inviolable according to law and the ancient oath. By not even waiting for the expiration of their office he sharpened the public indignation.

109 1 When <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> perceived this he repented, and, reflecting that this was the first severe and arbitrary act that he had done without military authority and in time of peace, it is said that he ordered his friends to protect him, since he had given his enemies the handle they were seeking against him. But when they asked him if he would bring together again his Spanish cohorts as a bodyguard, he said, "There is nothing more unlucky than perpetual watching; that is the part of one who is always afraid." Nor were the attempts to claim royal honours for him brought to an end even thus, for while he was in the forum looking at the games of the Lupercal, seated on his golden chair before the rostra, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, his colleague in the consulship, who was running naked and anointed, as was the priests' custom at that festival, sprang upon the rostra and put a diadem on his head. At this sight some few clapped their hands, but the greater number groaned, and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> threw off the diadem. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> again put it on him and again <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> threw it off. While they were thus contending the people remained silent, being in suspense to see how it would end. When they saw that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> prevailed they shouted for joy, and at the same time applauded him because he did not accept it.

110 1 And now <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, either renouncing his hope, or being tired out, and wishing by this time to avoid this plot and odium, or deliberately giving up the city to certain of his enemies, or hoping to cure his bodily ailment of epilepsy and convulsions, which came upon him suddenly and especially when he was inactive, conceived the idea of a long campaign against the Getae and the Parthians. The Getae, a hardy, warlike, and neighbouring nation, were to be attacked first. The Parthians were to be punished for their perfidy toward <persName n="133">Crassus</persName>. He sent across the Adriatic in advance sixteen legions of foot and 10,000 horse. And now another rumour gained currency that the Sibylline books had predicted that the Parthians would never submit to the Romans until the latter should be commanded by a king. For this reason some people ventured to say that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> ought to be called dictator and emperor of the Romans, as he was in fact, or whatever other name they might prefer to that of king, but he ought to be distinctly named king of the nations that were subject to the Romans. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> declined this also, and was wholly engaged in hastening his departure from the city in which he was exposed to such envy.

111 1 Four days before his intended departure he was slain by his enemies in the senate-house, either from jealousy of his fortune and power, now grown to enormous proportions, or, as they themselves alleged, from a desire to restore the republic of their fathers; for they feared (and in this they knew their man) that if he should conquer these nations also he would indeed be indisputably king. On mature consideration, I conclude that they did actually find an excuse for the conspiracy in the prospect of this additional title, though the difference it could make to them turned on a mere quibble, since in plain fact "dictator" is exactly the same as "king." Chief among the conspirators were two men, <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, (son of the <persName n="328">Marcus Brutus</persName> who was put to death during the Sullan revolution), who had sided with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> after the disaster of Pharsalus, and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, the one who had surrendered his triremes to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> in the Hellespont, both having been of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s party. Among the conspirators also was <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, one of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s dearest friends. All of them had been held in honour and trust by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> at all times. He had employed them in the greatest affairs. When he went to the war in Africa he gave them the command of armies, putting <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> in charge of Transalpine, and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> of Cisalpine, Gaul.

112 1 <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, who had been designated as praetors at the same time, had a controversy with each other as to which of them should be the city praetor, this being the place of highest honour, either because they were really ambitious of the distinction or as a pretence, so that they might not seem to have a common understanding with each other. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, who was chosen umpire between them, is reported to have said to his friends that justice seemed to be on the side of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, but that he must nevertheless favour <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>. He exhibited the same affection and preference for this man in all things. It was even thought that <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> was his son, as <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was the lover of his mother, <persName n="520">Servilia</persName> (<persName n="104">Cato</persName>'s sister) about the time of his birth, for which reason, when he won the victory at Pharsalus, it is said that he gave an immediate order to his officers to save <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> by all means. Whether <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> was ungrateful, or ignorant of his mother's fault, or disbelieved it, or was ashamed of it; whether he was such an ardent lover of liberty that he preferred his country to everything, or whether, because he was a descendant of that <persName n="296">Lucius Junius Brutus</persName> of the olden time who expelled the kings, he was aroused and shamed to this deed principally by the people, (for there were secretly affixed to the statues of the elder <persName n="296">Lucius Junius Brutus</persName> and also to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>' own tribunal such writings as, "<persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, are you bribed?" "<persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, are you dead?" "Thou should'st be living at this hour!" "Your posterity is unworthy of you," or "You are not his descendant,") — at any rate these and many like incentives fired the young man to a deed like that of his ancestor.

113 1 While the talk about the kingship was at its height, and just before there was to be a meeting of the Senate, <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> met <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, and, seizing him by the hand, said, "What shall we do in the senate-house if <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s flatterers propose a decree making him king?" <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> replied that he would not be there. Then <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> asked him further, "What if we are summoned there as praetors, what shall we do then, my good <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>?" "I will defend my country to the death," he replied. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> embraced him, saying, "If this is your mind, whom of the nobility will you not rally to your standard? Do you think it is artisans and shopkeepers who have written those clandestine messages on your tribunal, or is it rather the noblest Romans, who, though they ask from the other praetors games, horse-races, and combats of wild beasts, ask from you liberty, a boon worthy of your ancestry?" Thus did they disclose to each other what they had been privately thinking about for a long time. Each of them tested those of their own friends, and of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s also, whom they considered the most courageous of either faction. Of their own friends they inveigled two brothers, <persName n="84">Caecilius</persName> and <persName n="83">Bucolianus</persName>, and besides these <persName n="492">Rubrius Ruga</persName>, <persName n="473">Quintus Ligarius</persName>, <persName n="345">Marcus Spurius</persName>, <persName n="523">Servilius Galba</persName>, <persName n="530">Sextius Naso</persName>, and <persName n="426">Pontius Aquila</persName>. These were of their own faction. Of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s friends they secured <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, whom I have already mentioned, also <persName n="382">Casca</persName>, <persName n="579">Trebonius</persName>, <persName n="567">Tillius Cimber</persName>, and <persName n="371">Minucius Basilus</persName>.

114 1 When they thought that they had a sufficient number, and that it would not be wise to divulge the plot to any more, they pledged each other without oaths or sacrifices, yet no one changed his mind or betrayed the secret. They then sought time and place. Time was pressing because <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was to depart on his campaign four days hence and then a body-guard of soldiers would surround him. They chose the Senate as the place, believing that, even though the senators did not know of it beforehand, they would join heartily when they saw the deed; and it was said that this happened in the case of Romulus when he changed from a king to a tyrant. They thought that this deed, like that one of old, taking place in open Senate, would seem to be not in the way of a private conspiracy, but in behalf of the country, and that, being in the public interest, there would be no danger from <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s army. At the same time they thought the honour would remain theirs because the public would not be ignorant that they took the lead. For these reasons they unanimously chose the Senate as the place, but they were not agreed as to the mode. Some thought that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> ought to be killed also because he was consul with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and was his most powerful friend, and the one of most repute with the army; but <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> said that they would win the glory of tyrannicide from the death of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> alone, because that would be the killing of a king. If they should kill his friends also, the deed would be imputed to private enmity and to the Pompeian faction.

115 1 They listened to this reasoning and awaited the next meeting of the Senate, and the day before the meeting <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> went to dine with <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, his master of horse, taking <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> with him to drink wine after dinner, and while the wine went round the conversation <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> proposed the question, "What is the best kind of death?" Various opinions were given, but <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> alone expressed preference for a sudden death. In this way he foretold his own end, and conversed about what was to happen on the morrow. After the banquet a certain bodily faintness came over him in the night, and his wife, <persName n="94">Calpurnia</persName>, had a dream, in which she saw him streaming with blood, for which reason she tried to prevent him from going out in the morning. When he offered sacrifice there were many unfavourable signs. He was about to send <persName n="27">Antony</persName> to dismiss the Senate when <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, who was with him, persuaded him, in order not to incur the charge of disregard for the Senate, to go there and dismiss it himself. Games were going on in <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s theatre, and the Senate was about to assemble in one of the adjoining buildings, as was the custom when the games were taking place. <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> were early at the portico in front of the theatre, very calmly engaging in public business as praetors with those seeking their services. When they heard of the bad omens at <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s house and that the Senate was to be dismissed, they were greatly disconcerted. While they were in this state of mind a certain person took <persName n="382">Casca</persName> by the hand and said, "You kept the secret from me, although I am your friend, but <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> has told me all." <persName n="382">Casca</persName> was suddenly conscience-stricken and shuddered, but his friend, smiling, continued, "Where shall you get the money to stand for the aedileship?" Then <persName n="382">Casca</persName> recovered himself. While <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> were conferring and talking together, <persName n="428">Popilius Laena</persName>, one of the senators, drew them aside and said that he joined them in his prayers for what they had in mind, and he urged them to make haste. They were confounded, but remained silent from terror.

116 1 While <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was actually being borne to the Senate one of his intimates, who had learned of the conspiracy, ran to his house to tell what he knew. When he arrived there and found only <persName n="94">Calpurnia</persName> he merely said that he wanted to speak to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> about urgent business, and then waited for him to come back from the Senate, because he did not know all the particulars of the affair. Meantime <persName n="53">Artemidorus</persName>, whose hospitality <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had enjoyed at Cnidus, ran to the Senate and found him already in the death-throes. A tablet informing him of the conspiracy was put into <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s hand by another person while he was sacrificing in front of the senate-house, but he went in immediately and it was found in his hand after his death. Directly after he stepped out of the litter <persName n="428">Popilius Laena</persName>, who a little before had joined his prayers with the party of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, accosted <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and engaged him aside in earnest conversation. The sight of this proceeding and especially the length of the conversation struck terror into the hearts of the conspirators, and they made signs to each other that they would kill themselves rather than be captured. As the conversation was prolonged they saw that <persName n="428">Popilius Laena</persName> did not seem to be revealing anything to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, but rather to be urging some petition. They recovered themselves and when they saw him return thanks to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> after the conversation they took new courage. It was the custom of the magistrates, when about to enter the Senate, to take the auspices at the entrance. Here again <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s first victim was without a heart, or, as some say, the upper part of the entrails was wanting. The soothsayer said that this was a sign of death. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, laughing, said that the same thing had happened to him when he was beginning his campaign against <persName n="221">Gnaeus Pompey</persName> in Spain. The soothsayer replied that he had been in very great danger then and that now the omen was more deadly. So <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> ordered him to sacrifice again. None of the victims were more propitious; but being ashamed to keep the Senate waiting, and being urged by his enemies in the guise of friends, he went on disregarding the omens. For it was fated that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> should meet his fate.

117 1 The conspirators had left <persName n="579">Trebonius</persName>, one of their number, to engage <persName n="27">Antony</persName> in conversation at the door. The others, with concealed daggers, stood around <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> like friends as he sat in his chair. Then one of them, <persName n="567">Tillius Cimber</persName>, came up in front of him and petitioned him for the recall of his brother, who had been banished. When <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> answered that the matter must be deferred, <persName n="567">Tillius Cimber</persName> seized hold of his purple robe as though still urging his petition, and pulled it away so as to expose his neck, exclaiming, "Friends, what are you waiting for?" Then first <persName n="382">Casca</persName>, who was standing over <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s head, drove his dagger at his throat, but swerved and wounded him in the breast. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> snatched his toga from Cimber, seized <persName n="382">Casca</persName>'s hand, sprang from his chair, turned around, and hurled <persName n="382">Casca</persName> with great violence. While he was in this position another one stabbed him with a dagger in the side, which was stretched tense by his strained position.43 <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> wounded him in the face, <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> smote him in the thigh, and <persName n="83">Bucolianus</persName> in the back. With rage and outcries <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> turned now upon one and now upon another like a wild animal, but, after receiving the wound from <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>44 he at last despaired and, veiling himself with his robe, composed himself for death and fell at the foot of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s statue. They continued their attack after he had fallen until he had received twenty-three wounds. Several of them while thrusting with their swords wounded each other.

118 1 When the murderers had perpetrated their gloomy crime, in a sacred place, on one whose person was sacred and inviolable, there was an immediate flight throughout the curia and throughout the whole city. Some senators were wounded in the tumult and others killed. Many other citizens and strangers were murdered also, not designedly, but as such things happen in public commotions, by the mistakes of those into whose hands they fell. Gladiators, who had been armed early in the morning for that day's spectacles, ran out of the theatre to the screens45 of the senate-house. The theatre itself was emptied in haste and panic terror, and the markets were plundered. All citizens closed their doors and prepared for defence on their roofs. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> fortified his house, apprehending that conspiracy was against him as well as <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, the master of the horse, being in the forum at the time, learned what had been done and ran to the island in the river where he had a legion of soldiers, which he transferred to the Field of Mars in order to be in greater readiness to execute <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s orders; for he yielded to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> as a closer friend of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and also as consul. While pondering over the matter they were strongly moved to avenge the death of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, but they feared lest the Senate should espouse the side of the murderers and so they concluded to await events. There had been no military guard around <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, for he did not like guards; but the usual attendants of the magistracy, most of the officers, and a large crowd of citizens and strangers, of slaves and freedmen, had accompanied him from his house to the Senate. These had fled en masse, all except three slaves, who placed the body in the litter and, unsteadily enough, as three bearers would, bore homeward him, who, a little before, had been master of the earth and sea.

119 1 The murderers wished to make a speech in the Senate, but as nobody remained there they wrapped their togas around their left arms to serve as shields, and, with swords still reeking with blood, ran, crying out that they had slain a king and tyrant. One of them bore a ca on the end of a spear as a symbol of freedom, and exhorted the people to restore the government of their fathers and recall the memory of the elder <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and of those who took the oath together against ancient kings. With them ran some with drawn swords who had not participated in the deed, but wanted to share the glory, among whom were <persName n="261">Lentulus Spinther</persName>, <persName n="164">Favonius</persName>, <persName n="38">Aquinus</persName>, <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, <persName n="379">Murcus</persName>, and <persName n="400">Patiscus</persName>. These did not share the glory, but they suffered punishment with the guilty. As the people did not flock to them they were disconcerted and alarmed. Although the Senate had at first fled through ignorance and alarm, they had confidence in it nevertheless as consisting of their own relatives and friends, and oppressed equally with themselves by the tyranny; but they were suspicious of the plebeians and of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s soldiers, many of whom were then present in the city, some lately dismissed from the service, to whom lands had been allotted; others who had been already settled, but had come in to serve as an escort for <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> on his departure from the city. The assassins had fears of <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, too, and of the army under him in the city, and also of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> in his character as consul, lest he should consult the people alone, instead of the Senate, and bring some fearful punishment upon them.

120 1 In this frame of mind they hastened up to the Capitol with their gladiators. There they took counsel and decided to bribe the populace, hoping that if some would begin to praise the deed others would join in from love of liberty and longing for the republic. They thought that the genuinely Roman people were still as they had learned that they were when the elder <persName n="296">Lucius Junius Brutus</persName> expelled the kings. They did not perceive that they were counting on two incompatible things, namely, that people could be lovers of liberty and bribe-takers at the same time. The latter class were much easier to find of the two, because the government had been corrupt for a long time. For the plebeians are now much mixed with foreign blood, freedmen have equal rights of citizenship with them, and slaves are dressed in the same fashion as their masters. Except in the case of the senatorial rank the same costume is common to slaves and to free citizens. Moreover the distribution of corn to the poor, which takes place in Rome only, draws thither the lazy, the beggars, the vagrants of all Italy. The multitude, too, of discharged soldiers who were no longer dispersed one by one to their native places as formerly, through fear lest some of them might have engaged in unjustifiable wars, but were sent in groups to unjust allotments of lands and confiscated houses, was at that time encamped in temples and sacred enclosures under one standard, and one person appointed to lead them to their colony, and as they had already sold their own belongings preparatory to their departure they were in readiness to be bought for any purpose.

121 1 From so many men of this kind a considerable crowd was drawn speedily and without difficulty to the party of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> in the forum. These, although bought, did not dare to praise the murder, because they feared <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s reputation and doubted what course the rest of the people might take. So they shouted for peace as being for the public advantage, and with one accord recommended this policy to the magistrates, intending by this device to secure the safety of the murderers; for there could be no peace without amnesty to them. While they were thus engaged the praetor <persName n="112">Cinna</persName>, a relative of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> by marriage, made his appearance, advanced unexpectedly into the middle of the forum, laid aside his praetorian robe, as if disdaining the gift of a tyrant, and called <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> a tyrant and his murderers tyrannicides. He extolled their deed as exactly like that of their ancestors, and ordered that the men themselves should be called from the Capitol as benefactors and rewarded with public honours. So spake <persName n="112">Cinna</persName>, but when the hirelings saw that the unbought portion of the crowd did not agree with them they did not call for the men in the Capitol, nor did they do anything else but continually demand peace.

122 1 But after <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, a young man of noble family who had been chosen by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> as consul for the remainder of his own year when he was about to leave the city, and who had put on the consular garb and taken the other insignia of the office, came forward next and railed against the man who had advanced him to this dignity and pretended that he was privy to the conspiracy against him, and that his hand alone was unwillingly absent — some say that he even proposed a decree that this day should be consecrated as the birthday of the republic — then indeed the hirelings took new courage, seeing that they had both a praetor and a consul on their side, and demanded that <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and his friends be summoned from the Capitol. They were delighted with <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> and thought that now they had a young optimate, who was also a consul, to oppose against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. Only <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> came down, the latter with his hand still bleeding from the wound he had received when he and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> were dealing blows at <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. When they reached the forum neither of them said anything which betokened humility. On the contrary, they praised each other, as though the deed were something confessedly honourable, congratulated the city, and bore special testimony to the merits of <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> because he had furnished them gladiators at a critical moment. They exhorted the people to be like their ancestors, who had expelled the kings, although the latter were exercising the government not by violence like <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, but had been chosen according to law. They advised the recall of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> (the son of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, the defender of the republic against <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>), who was still warring against <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s lieutenants in Spain. They also recommended that the tribunes, <persName n="91">Caesetius Flavus</persName> and <persName n="156">Epidius Marullus</persName>, who had been deposed by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, should be recalled from exile.

123 1 After they had thus spoken <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> returned directly to the Capitol, because they had not yet entire confidence in the present posture of affairs. As their friends and relatives were then first enabled to come to them in the temple, they chose from them messengers to treat on their behalf with <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> for conciliation and the preservation of liberty, and for warding off the evils that would befall the country if they should not come to an agreement. This the messengers besought, not, however, extolling the deed that had been done, for they did not dare to do this in the presence of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s friends, but asking that it be tolerated now that it was done, out of pity for the perpetrators, (who had been actuated, not by hatred towards <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, but by love of country), and out of compassion for the city exhausted by long-continued civil strife, which a new sedition might deprive of the good men still remaining. "If enmity is entertained against certain persons," they said, "it will be an act of impiety to gratify it in a time of public danger. It is far preferable to merge private animosity in the public welfare, or, if anybody were irreconcilable, at least to postpone his private grievances for the present."

124 1 <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> wished to avenge <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, as I have already said, either on the score of friendship, or of the oaths they had sworn, or because they were aiming at the supreme power themselves and thought that their course would be easier if so many men of such rank were put out of the way at once. But they feared the friends and relatives of these men and the leaning of the rest of the Senate toward them, and especially they feared <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, who had been chosen by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> governor of Transalpine Gaul, which had a large army. So they decided to watch a future opportunity and to try if possible to draw over to themselves the army of <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, which was already disheartened by its protracted labours. Having come to this decision, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> replied to the messengers, "We shall do nothing from private enmity, yet in consequence of the crime and of the oaths we have all sworn to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, that we would either protect his person or avenge his death, a solemn regard for our oath requires us to drive out the guilty and to live with smaller number of innocent men rather than that all should be liable to the divine curse. Yet for our own part, although this seems to us the proper course, we will consider the matter with you in the Senate and we will consider as propitious for the city whatever you may approve in common."

125 1 Thus did <persName n="27">Antony</persName> make a safe answer. The messengers returned their thanks and went away full of hope, for they had entire confidence that the Senate would co-operate with them. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> ordered the magistrates to have the city watched by night, stationing guards at intervals as in the daytime, and there were fires throughout the city. By their aid the friends of the murderers were enabled to traverse the city the whole night, going to the houses of the senators and beseeching them in behalf of these men and of the republic. On the other hand, the leaders of the colonised soldiers ran about uttering threats in case they should fail to hold the lands set apart, either already assigned or promised to them. And now the more honest citizens began to recover courage when they learned how small was the number of the conspirators, and when they remembered <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s merits they became much divided in opinion. That same night <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s money and his official papers were transferred to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s house, either because <persName n="94">Calpurnia</persName> thought that they would be safer there or because <persName n="27">Antony</persName> ordered it.

126 1 While these things were taking place <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, by means of a notice sent round by night, called the Senate to meet before daybreak at the temple of Tellus, which was very near his own house, because he did not dare to go to the senate-house situated just below the Capitol, where the gladiators were aiding the conspirators, nor did he wish to disturb the city by bringing in the army. <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, however, did that. As daylight was approaching the senators assembled at the temple of Tellus, including the praetor <persName n="112">Cinna</persName>, clothed again in the robe of office which he had cast off the previous day as the gift of a tyrant. Some of the unbribed people and some of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s veterans, when they saw him were indignant that he, although a relative of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, should have been the first to slander him in a public speech, threw stones at him, pursued him, and when he had taken refuge in a house brought fagots and were about to set it on fire when <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> came up with his soldiers and stopped them.

This was the first decided expression of opinion in favour of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. The hirelings, and the murderers themselves, were alarmed by it. 127 1 In the Senate, however, only a small number were free from sympathy with the act of violence and indignant at the murder, while most of them sought to aid the murderers in various ways. They proposed first to invite them to be present under a pledge of safety and sit in council with them, thus changing them from criminals to judges. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> did not oppose this because he knew they would not come; and they did not come. Then, in order to test the feeling of the Senate, some senators extolled the deed openly and without disguise, called the men tyrannicides, and proposed that they should be rewarded. Others were opposed to giving rewards, saying that the men did not want them and had not done the deed for the sake of reward, but claiming that they should merely be thanked as public benefactors. Still others secretly tried to get rid of the vote of thanks and thought that it would be sufficient to grant them impunity.

Such were the devices to which they resorted, trying to discover which of these courses the Senate would be inclined to accept first, hoping that after a little the body would be more easily led on by them to the other measures. The honester portion revolted at the murder as impious, but out of respect for the distinguished families of the murderers would not oppose the granting of impunity, yet they were indignant at the proposal to honour them as public benefactors. Others argued that if impunity were granted it would not be fitting to refuse the most ample means of safety. When one speaker said that honouring them would be dishonouring <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, it was answered that it was not permissible to prefer the interests of the dead to those of the living. Another vigorously put it in the form of a dilemma: they must either decree <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> a tyrant or protect the murderers as an act of clemency. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s enemies seized upon this last proposition only, and asked that an opportunity be given them of expressing themselves by vote concerning the character of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, under oath, stipulating that, if they voluntarily should give their unbiassed judgment, no one should invoke the gods against them for having previously voted <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s decrees under compulsion — never willingly, and never until they were in fear for their own lives, after the death of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and of numberless others besides <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>.

128 1 When <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who had been looking on and waiting his turn, saw that a large volume of incontestable argument was being brought forward, he resolved to make chaos of their logic by exciting personal fear and anxiety for themselves. Knowing that a great number of these very senators had been designated by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> for city magistracies, priestly offices, and the command of provinces and armies (for, as he was going on a long expedition, he had appointed them for five years), <persName n="27">Antony</persName> proclaimed silence as consul and said: "those who are asking for a vote on the character of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> must first know that if he was a magistrate and if he was an elected ruler of the State all his acts and decrees will remain in full force; but if it is decided that he usurped the government by violence, his body should be cast out unburied and all his acts annulled. These acts, to speak briefly, embrace the whole earth and sea, and most of them will stand whether we like them or not, as I shall presently show. Those things which alone belong to us to consider, because they concern us alone, I will suggest to you first, so that you may gain a conception of the more difficult questions from a consideration of the easier ones. Almost all of us have held office under <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>; or do so still, having been chosen thereto by him; or will do so soon, having been designated in advance by him; for, as you know, he had disposed of the city offices, the yearly magistracies, and the command of provinces and armies for five years. If you are willing to resign these offices (for this is entirely in your power), I will put that question to you first and then I will take up the remaining ones."

129 1 Having lighted this kind of firebrand among them, not in reference to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, but to themselves, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> relapsed into silence. They rose immediately en masse, and with loud clamour protested against new elections or submitting their claims to the people. They preferred to keep a firm hold on what they possessed. Some were opposed to new elections because they were not of lawful age, or from some other unavowed reason, and among these was the consul <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> himself, who could not legally stand for an election to that office as he was only twenty-five years old. Although he had pretended yesterday that he had a share in the conspiracy, a sudden change came over him, and now he reviled the majority for seeking to confer honour on murderers and dishonouring their own magistrates under the pretext of securing the safety of the former. Some encouraged <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> himself and the other magistrates to believe that they would obtain for them the same positions from the people's gratitude without any change of officers, but simply by the more legal method of election in place of monarchical appointment, and that it would be an additional honour to them to hold the same places under the monarchy and the republic. While these speakers were still talking some of the praetors, in order to ensnare the opposing faction, laid aside their robes of office as if they were about to exchange them for a more legal title to their places, in common with the others; but the others did not fall into the trap. They knew that these men could not control the future election.

130 1 While affairs were proceeding thus, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> went out of the Senate, having been called for by a crowd that had been assembling for some time. When they were perceived in an elevated place, and the shouters had been with difficulty silenced, one of the mob, either of his own volition or because he was prompted, called out, "Have a care lest you suffer a like fate." <persName n="27">Antony</persName> loosened his tunic and showed him a coat-of‑mail inside, thus exciting the beholders, as though it were impossible even for consuls to be safe without arms. Some cried out that the deed must be avenged, but a greater number demanded peace. To those who called for peace <persName n="27">Antony</persName> said, "That is what we are striving for, that it may come and be permanent, but it is hard to get security for it when so many oaths and solemnities were of no avail in the case of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>." Then, turning to those who demanded vengeance, he praised them as more observant of the obligations of oaths and religion, and added, "I myself would join you and would be the first to call for vengeance if I were not the consul, who must care for what is said to be for the common good rather than for what is just. So these people who are inside tell us. So <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself perhaps thought when, for the good of the country, he spared those citizens whom he captured in war, and was slain by them."

131 1 When <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had in this way worked upon both parties by turns, those who wanted to have vengeance on the murderers asked <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> to execute it. As <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> was about to speak those who were standing at a distance asked him to come down to the forum where all could hear him equally well. So he went directly there, thinking that the crowd was now changing its mind, and when he had taken his place on the rostra he groaned and wept in plain sight for some time. Then recovering himself, he said, "Yesterday I stood with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> here, where now I am compelled to ask what you wish me to do about <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s murder." Many cried out, "Avenge <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>." The hirelings shouted on the other side, "Peace for the republic." To the latter he replied, "Agreed, but what kind of a peace do you mean? By what sort of oaths shall it be confirmed? We all swore the national oaths to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and we have trampled on them — we who are considered the most distinguished of the oath-takers." Then, turning to those who called for vengeance, he said, "<persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, that truly sacred and revered man, has gone from us, but we hesitate to deprive the republic of those who still remain. Our senators," he added, "are considering these matters, and this is the opinion of the majority." They shouted again, "Avenge him yourself." "I should like to," he replied, "and my oath permits me to do it even alone, but it is not fitting that you and I alone should wish it, or alone refuse it."

132 1 While <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> was employing such devices the hirelings, who knew that he was ambitious, praised him and offered him <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s place as pontifex maximus. He was delighted. "Mention this to me later," he said, "if you consider me worthy of it," whereupon the hirelings, encouraged by their offer of the priesthood, insisted still more strongly on peace. "Although it is contrary to religion and law," he said, "I will do what you wish." So saying he returned to the Senate, where <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> had consumed all the intervening time in unseemly talk about his own office. <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who was waiting to see what the people would do, looked at <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> with derision, for the two were at variance with each other. After enjoying the spectacle sufficiently and perceiving that the people had not done anything rashly, he decided, under compulsion, to extend protection to the murderers (concealing the necessity, however, and pretending to act in this way as a matter of the greatest favour), and at the same time to have <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s acts ratified and his plans carried into effect by common agreement.

133 1 Accordingly he commanded silence again and spoke as follows; "While you, my compeers, have been considering the case of the offending citizens, I have not joined in the debate. When you called for a vote on <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> instead of on them, I had brought forward, until this moment, only one of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s acts. This one threw you into these many present controversies, and not without reason, for if we resign our offices we shall confess that we (so many and of such high rank as we are) came by them undeservedly. Consider the matters that cannot be easily controlled by us. Reckon them up by cities and provinces, by kings and princes. Almost all of these, from the rising to the setting sun, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> either subdued for us by force and arms, or organised by his laws, or confirmed in their allegiance by his favours and kindness. Which of these powers do you think will consent to be deprived of what they have received, unless you mean to fill the world with new wars — you who propose to spare these wretches for the sake of your exhausted country?

"But, omitting the more distant dangers and apprehensions, we have others not only near at hand, but even of our own household throughout Italy itself — men who, after receiving the rewards of victory, are here in great numbers with arms in their hands just as when on service, men assigned to colonies in their old organisation by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> (many thousands of whom are still in the city), and what think you they will do if they are deprived of what they have received, or expect to receive, in town and country? The past night showed you a sample.

134 1 "They were coursing the streets with threats against you who were supplicating in behalf of the murderers; and do you think that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s fellow-soldiers will overlook his body being dragged through the streets, dishonoured, and cast out unburied? For our laws prescribe such treatment for tyrants. Will they consider the rewards they have received for their victories in Gaul and Britain secure, when he who gave them is treated with contumely? What will the Roman people themselves do? What the Italians? What ill-will of gods and men will attend you if you put ignominy upon one who advanced your dominion to shores of the ocean hitherto unknown? Will not such inconsistency on our part be rather held in reprobation and condemnation if we vote to confer honour on those who have slain a consul in the senate-house, an inviolable man in an inviolable place, in full senate, under the eyes of the gods, and if we dishonour one whom even our enemies honour for his bravery? I warn you to abstain from these proceedings as sacrilegious and beyond our power. I move that all the acts and intentions of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> be ratified and that the authors of the crime be by no means applauded (for that would be neither pious, nor just, nor consistent with the ratification of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s acts), but be spared, if you please, as an act of clemency only, for the sake of their families and friends, if the latter will accept it in this sense in behalf of the murderers and acknowledge it in the light of a favour."

135 1 When <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had said these things with intense feeling and impetuosity, all the others remaining silent and agreeing, a decree was passed: that there should be no prosecution for the murder of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, but all his acts and decrees should be confirmed, "because this policy is advantageous to the commonwealth." The friends of the murderers insisted that those last word should be added for their security, implying that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s acts were confirmed as a measure of utility and not of justice; and in this matter <persName n="27">Antony</persName> yielded to them. When this decree had been voted the leaders of the colonists who were present asked for another act special to themselves, in addition to the general one, in order to secure them in possession of their colonies. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> did not oppose this, but rather intimidated the Senate into passing it. So this was adopted, and another like it concerning the colonists who had been already sent out. The Senate was thereupon dismissed, and a number of senators collected around <persName n="283">Lucius Calpurnius Piso</persName>, whom <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had made the custodian of his will, and urged him not to make the will public, and not to give the body a public burial, lest some new disturbance should arise therefrom. As he would not yield they threatened him with a public prosecution for defrauding the people of such an amount of wealth which ought to go into the public treasury; thus giving new signs that they were suspicious of a tyranny.

136 1 Then <persName n="283">Lucius Calpurnius Piso</persName> called out with a loud voice and demanded that the consuls should reconvene the senators, who were still present, which was done, and then he said: "These men who talk of having killed a tyrant are already so many tyrants over us in place of one. They forbid me to bury the Pontifex Maximus and they threaten me when I produce his will. Moreover, they intend to confiscate his property as that of a tyrant. They have ratified <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s acts as regards themselves, but they annul those which relate to himself. It is no longer <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> or <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> who do this, but those who instigated them to the murder. Of his burial you are the masters. Of his will I am, and never will I betray what has been entrusted to me unless somebody kills me also." This speech excited clamour and indignation on all sides, and especially among those who hoped that they should obtain something from the will. It was finally decreed that the will should be read in public and that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> should have a public funeral. Thereupon the Senate adjourned.

137 1 When <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> learned what had been done they sent messengers to the plebeians, whom they invited to come up to them at the Capitol. Presently a large number came together and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> addressed them as follows; "Here, citizens, we meet you, we who yesterday met together with you in the forum. We have come hither, not as taking refuge in a sanctuary (for we have done nothing wrong), nor in a citadel (for as regards our own affairs we entrusted ourselves to you), but the sudden and unexpected attack made upon <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> compelled us to do so. I know that our enemies accuse us of perjury and say that we render a lasting peace difficult. What we have to reply to these accusations we will say in your presence, citizens, with whom in this as in all other respects enjoying democratic government, we shall act. After <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> advanced from Gaul with hostile arms against his country, and <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, the strongest supporters of democracy among you suffered as he did, and after him a great number of other good citizens, who had been driven into Africa and Spain, had perished, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was naturally apprehensive, although his power was firmly entrenched, and we granted him amnesty at his request and confirmed it by oath. If he had required us to swear not only to condone the past, but to be willing slaves for the future, what would our present enemies have done? For my part I think that, being Romans, they would have chosen to die many times than take an oath of voluntary servitude.

138 1 "If <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was doing no more against your liberty then we are perjured. But if he restored to you neither the magistracies of the city nor those of the provinces, neither the command of armies, the priestly offices, the leadership of colonies, nor any other posts of honour; if he neither consulted the Senate about anything nor asked the authority of the people, but if <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s command was all in all; if he was not even ever satiated with our misfortunes as <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> was (for <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, when he had destroyed his enemies, restored to you the government of the commonwealth, but <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, as he was going away for another long military expedition, anticipated by his appointments your elections for five years), what sort of freedom was this in which not a ray of hope could be any longer discerned? What shall I say of the defenders of the people, <persName n="91">Caesetius Flavus</persName> and <persName n="156">Epidius Marullus</persName>? Were not the holders of a sacred and inviolable office ignominiously banished? Although the law and the oath prescribed by our ancestors forbid calling the tribunes to account during their term of office, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> banished them even without a trial.

"Have we then, or has he, done violence to inviolable persons? Or shall <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> indeed be sacred and inviolable, upon whom we conferred that distinction not of our own free will, but by compulsion, and not until he had invaded his country with arms and killed a great number of our noblest and best citizens, whereas our fathers in a democracy and without compulsion took an oath that the office of tribune should be sacred and inviolable, and declare with maledictions that it should remain so for ever? What has become of the public tribute during his supremacy? What of the accounts? Who opened the public treasury without our consent? Who laid hands upon part of the consecrated money? Who threatened with death another tribune who opposed him?

139 1 " 'But what kind of oath after this will be a guarantee of peace?' they ask. If there is no tyrant there will be no need of oaths. Our fathers never needed any. If anybody else seeks to establish tyranny, no faith, no oath, will ever bind Romans to the tyrant. This we say, while still in danger; this we will continue to say for ever for our country's sake. We, who held places honour securely in the suite of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, had a higher regard for our country than for our offices. They slander us about the colonies and so excite you against us. If there are any present who have been settled in colonies, or are about to be settled, you will gratify me by making yourself known."

140 1 A large number did so, whereupon <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> continued, "It is a good thing, my men, that you have done to come here with the others. You ought, since you receive due honours and bounties from your country, to give equal honour in return to her who sends you forth. The Roman people gave you to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> to fight against the Gauls and Britons, and your valiant deeds call for recognition and recompense. But <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, taking advantage of your military oath, led you against your country much against your desire. He led you against our best citizens in Africa, in like manner against your will. If this were all that you had done you would perhaps be ashamed to ask reward for such exploits, but since neither envy, nor time, nor the forgetfulness of men can extinguish the glory of your deeds in Gaul and Britain, you have the rewards due to them, such as the people gave to those who served in the army of old, yet not by taking land from unoffending fellow-citizens, nor by dividing other people's property with newcomers, nor by considering it proper to requite services by means of acts of injustice.

"When our ancestors overcame their enemies they did not take from them all their land. They shared it with them and colonized a portion of it with Roman soldiers, who were to serve as guards over the vanquished. If the conquered territory was not sufficient for the colonies, they added some of the public domain or bought other land with the public money. In this way the people established you in colonies without harm to anybody. But <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, who invaded their country like a foreign land, and needed guard and garrisons against their own country, did not dismiss you to your homes, nor buy land for you, nor divide among you the property of citizens which they confiscated, nor did they make compensation for the relief of those who were despoiled, although those who despoiled them had plenty of money from the treasury and plenty from confiscated estates. By the law of war, — nay, by the practice of robbery, — they took from Italians who had committed no offence, who had done no wrong, their land and houses, tombs and temples, which we were not accustomed to take away even from foreign enemies, but merely to impose on them a tenth of their produce by way of tax.

141 1 "They divided among you the property of your own people, the very men who sent you with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> to the Gallic war, and who offered up their prayers at your festival of victory. They colonized you in that way collectively, under your standards and in your military organization, so that you could neither enjoy peace nor be free from fear of those whom you displaced. The man who was driven out and deprived of his goods was sure to be watching his opportunity to step into your shoes. This was the very thing that the tyrants sought to accomplish, — not to provide you with land, which they could have obtained for you elsewhere; but that you, because always beset by lurking enemies, might be the firm bulwark of a government that was committing wrongs in common with you. A common interest between tyrants and their satellites grows out of common crimes and common fears. And this, ye gods, they called colonization, which was crowned by the lamentations of a kindred people and the expulsion of innocent men from their homes.

"They purposely made you enemies to your countrymen for their own advantage. We, the defenders of the republic, to whom our opponents say they grant safety out of pity, confirm this very same land to you and will confirm it for ever; and to this promise we call to witness the god of this temple. You have and shall keep what you have received. No man assuredly shall take it from you, neither <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, nor <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, nor any of us who have incurred danger for your freedom. The one thing which is faulty in this business we will remedy, and that remedy will at once reconcile you with your fellow-countrymen and prove most agreeable to them as soon as they hear of it. We shall at once pay them out of the public money the price of this land of which they have been deprived; so that not only shall your colony be secure, but it shall not even be exposed to hatred."

142 1 While <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> was still speaking in this sort, and as the assembly dissolved, his discourse was approved by all as being entirely just. He and his associates were admired as men of intrepidity, and as peculiarly the friends of the people. The latter were once more favourably inclined toward them, and promised to co-operate with them on the following day. At daybreak the consuls called the people to an assembly and communicated to them the decisions of the Senate, and <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> pronounced a long encomium on the decree of amnesty. The people were delighted with it and invited <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and his friends to come down from the Capitol. The latter asked that hostages be sent to them in the meantime, and, accordingly, the sons of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> were sent. When <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and his associates made their appearance they were received with shouts and applause, and when the consuls desired to say something the people would not allow them to do so, but demanded that they should first shake hands with these men and make peace with them, and this was done. The minds of the consuls were much disturbed by fear or envy, for they thought that the conspirators might get the upper hand of them in other political matters.

143 1 <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s will was now produced and the people ordered that it be read at once. In it <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, the grandson of his sister, was adopted by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. His gardens were given to the people as a place of recreation, and to every Roman still living in the city he gave seventy-five Attic drachmas. The people were again somewhat stirred to anger when they saw the will of this lover of his country, whom they had before heard accused of tyranny. Most of all did it seem pitiful to them that <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, one of the murderers, should have been named by him for adoption in the second degree; for it was customary for the Romans to name alternate heirs in case of the failure of the first. Whereupon there was still greater disturbance among the people, who considered it shocking and sacrilegious that <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> should have conspired against <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> when he had been adopted as his son. When <persName n="283">Lucius Calpurnius Piso</persName> brought <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s body into the forum a countless multitude ran together with arms to guard it, and with acclamations and magnificent pageantry placed it on the rostra. Wailing and lamentation were renewed for a long time, the armed men clashed their shields, and gradually they began to repent themselves of the amnesty. <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, seeing how things were going, did not abandon his purpose, but, having been chosen to deliver the funeral oration, as a consul for a consul, a friend for a friend, a relative for a relative (for he was related to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> on his mother's side), resumed his artful design, and spoke as follows:—

144 1 "It is not fitting, citizens, that the funeral oration of so great a man should be pronounced by me alone, but rather by his whole country. The decrees which all of us, in equal admiration of his merit, voted to him while he was alive — the Senate and the people acting together — I will read, so that I may voice your sentiments rather than my own." Then he began to read with a severe and gloomy countenance, pronouncing each sentence distinctly and dwelling especially on those decrees which declared <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> to be superhuman, sacred, and inviolable, and which named him the father, or the benefactor, or the peerless protector of his country. With each decree <persName n="27">Antony</persName> turned his face and his hand toward <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s corpse, illustrating his discourse by his action, and at each appellation he added some brief remark full of grief and indignation; as, for example, where the decree spoke of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> as 'the father of his country' he added "this was a testimonial of his clemency"; and again, where he was made 'sacred and inviolable' and 'everybody else was to be held unharmed who should find refuge with him' — Nobody," said <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, "who found refuge with him was harmed, but he, whom you declared sacred and inviolable, was killed, although he did not extort these honours from you as a tyrant, and did not even ask for them. Most lacking the spirit of free men are we if we give such honours to the unworthy who do not ask for them. But you, faithful citizens, vindicate us from this charge of lacking the spirit of free men by paying such honours as you now pay to the dead."

145 1 <persName n="27">Antony</persName> resumed his reading and recited the oaths by which all were pledged to guard <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s body with all their strength, and all were devoted to perdition who should not avenge him against any conspiracy. Here, lifting up his voice and extending his hand toward the Capitol, he exclaimed, "Jupiter, guardian of this city, and ye other gods, I stand ready to avenge him as I have sworn and vowed, but since those who are of equal rank with me have considered the decree of amnesty beneficial, I pray that it may prove so." A commotion arose among the senators in consequence of this exclamation, which seemed to have special reference to them. So <persName n="27">Antony</persName> soothed them again and recanted, saying, "It seems to me, fellow-citizens, that this deed is not the work of human beings, but of some evil spirit. It becomes us to consider the present rather than the past, since the greatest danger approaches, if it is not already here, lest we be drawn into our former civil commotions and lose whatever remains of noble birth in the city. Let us then conduct this sacred one to the abode of the blest, chanting over him our accustomed hymn and lamentation."

146 1 Having spoken thus, he gathered up his garments like one inspired, girded himself so that he might have the free use of his hands, took his position in front of the bier as in a play, bending down to it and rising again, and first hymned him as a celestial deity, raising his hands to heaven in order to testify to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s divine birth. At the same time with rapid speech he recited his wars, his battles, his victories, the nations he had brought under his country's sway, and the spoils he had sent home, extolling each exploit as miraculous, and all the time exclaiming, "Thou alone hast come forth unvanquished from all the battles thou hast fought. Thou alone hast avenged thy country of the outrage put upon it 300 years ago, bringing to their knees those savage tribes, the only ones that ever broke into and burned the city of Rome." Many other things <persName n="27">Antony</persName> said in a kind of divine frenzy, and then lowered his voice from its high pitch to a sorrowful tone, and mourned and wept as for a friend who had suffered unjustly, and solemnly vowed that he was willing to give his own life in exchange for <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s.

Carried away by an easy transition to extreme passion he uncovered the body of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, lifted his robe on the point of a spear and shook it aloft, pierced with dagger-thrusts and red with the dictator's blood. Whereupon the people, like a chorus in a play, mourned with him in the most sorrowful manner, and from sorrow became filled again with anger. After the discourse other lamentations were chanted with funeral music according to the national custom, by the people in chorus, to the dead; and his deeds and his sad fate were again recited. Somewhere from the midst of these lamentations <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself was supposed to speak, recounting by name his enemies on whom he had conferred benefits, and of the murderers themselves exclaiming, as it were in amazement, "Oh that I should have spared these men to slay me!"47 The people could endure it no longer. It seemed to them monstrous that all the murderers who, with the single exception of <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, had been made prisoners while belonging to the faction of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, and who, instead of being punished, had been advanced by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> to the magistracies of Rome and to the command of provinces and armies, should have conspired against him; and that <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> should have been deemed by him worthy of adoption as his son.

147 1 While they were in this temper and were already near to violence, somebody raised above the bier an image of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself made of wax. The body itself, as it lay on its back on the couch, could not be seen. The image was turned round and round by a mechanical device, showing the twenty-three wounds in all parts of the body and on the face, that had been dealt to him so brutally. The people could no longer bear the pitiful sight presented to them. They groaned, and, girding up their loins, they burned the senate-chamber where <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was slain, and ran hither and thither searching for the murderers, who had fled some time previously. They were so mad with rage and grief that meeting the tribune <persName n="111">Cinna</persName>, on account of his similarity of name to the praetor <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> who had made a speech against <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, not waiting to hear any explanation about the similarity of name, they tore him to pieces like wild beasts so that no part of him was ever found for burial. They carried fire to the houses of the other murderers, but the domestics besought them to desist. So the people abstained from the use of fire, but they threatened to come back with arms on the following day.

148 1 The murderers fled from the city secretly. The people returned to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s bier and bore it as a consecrated thing to the Capitol in order to bury it in the temple and place it among the gods. Being prevented from doing so by the priests, they placed it again in the forum where stands the ancient palace of the kings of Rome. There they collected together pieces of wood and benches, of which there were many in the forum, and anything else they could find of that sort, for a funeral pile, throwing on it the adornments of the procession, some of which were very costly. Some of them cast their own crowns upon it and many military gifts. Then they set fire to it, and the entire people remained by the funeral pile throughout the night. There an altar was first erected, but now there stands the temple of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself, as he was deemed worthy of divine honours; for <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, his son by adoption, who took the name of xxxx, and, following in his footsteps in political matters, greatly strengthened the government which was founded by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and remains to this day, decreed divine honours to his father. From this example the Romans now pay like honours to each emperor at his death if he has not reigned in a tyrannical manner or made himself odious, although at first they could not bear to call them kings even while alive.

149 1 So died <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> on the Ides of March, which correspond nearly with the middle of the Greek month Anthesterion, which day the soothsayer predicted that he should not survive. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> jokingly said to him early in the morning, "Well, the Ides have come," and the latter, nothing daunted, answered, "But not gone." Despising such prophecies, uttered with so much confidence by the soothsayer, and other prodigies that I have previously mentioned, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> went on his way and met his death, being fifty-six years of age,48 a man most fortunate in all things, superhuman, of grand designs, and fit to be compared with <persName n="10">Alexander</persName>. Both were men of the greatest ambition, both were most skilled in the art of war, most rapid in executing their decisions, most reckless of danger, least sparing of themselves, and relying as much on audacity and luck as on military skill. <persName n="10">Alexander</persName> made a long journey through the desert in the hot season to visit the oracle of Ammon and crossed the Gulf of Pamphylia beating back a head sea most fortunately, for his good fortune restrained the waves for him until he had passed over, and sent him rain on his journey by land. On his way to India he ventured upon an unknown sea. Once he was the first to ascend the scaling ladders and leaped over the wall among his enemies alone, and in this condition received thirteen wounds. Yet he was never defeated, and he finished almost every war in one or two battles. He conquered many foreign nations in Europe and made himself master of Greece, a people hard to control, fond of freedom, who boasted that they had never obeyed anybody before him, except <persName n="409">Philip</persName> for a little while under the guise of his leadership in war; and he also overran almost the whole of Asia. To sum up <persName n="10">Alexander</persName>'s fortune and power in a word, he acquired as much of the earth as he had seen, and died while he was considering and devising means to capture the rest.

150 1 So too the Adriatic Sea yielded to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, becoming navigable and quiet in mid-winter. He also crossed the western ocean to Britain, which had never been attempted before, and he ordered his pilots to break their ships in pieces by running them on the rocks of the British coast. He was exposed to the violence of another tempest when alone in a small boat by night, and he ordered the pilot to spread his sails and to keep in mind <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s fortune rather than the waves of the sea. He often dashed against the enemy single-handed when all others were afraid. He fought thirty pitched battles in Gaul alone, where he conquered forty nations so formidable to the Romans previously that in the law which exempted priests and old men from military enrolment a formal exception was made 'in case of a Gallic inroad'; for then both priests and old men were required to serve. Once in the course of the Alexandrian war, when he was left alone on a bridge in extreme peril, he threw off his purple garment, leaped into the sea, and, being sought by the enemy, swam under water a long distance, coming to the surface only at intervals to take breath, until he came near a friendly ship, when he stretched out his hands and made himself known, and was saved.

In these civil wars, in which he engaged either through apprehension, as he says, or ambition, he was brought in conflict with the first generals of the age and with many large armies, not now of barbarians, but of Romans in the highest state of efficiency and good fortune, and, like <persName n="10">Alexander</persName>, he overcame them all by one or two engagements with each. His forces, however, were not, like <persName n="10">Alexander</persName>'s, always victorious, for they were defeated by the Gauls most disastrously under the command of his lieutenants, <persName n="131">Cotta</persName> and <persName n="570">Titurius</persName>; and in Spain <persName n="405">Petreius</persName> and <persName n="8">Afranius</persName> shut them up like an army besieged. At Dyrrachium and in Africa they were put to flight, and in Spain they were terrified by the younger <persName n="221">Gnaeus Pompey</persName>. But <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself was always undaunted and was victorious at the end of every war. He grasped, partly by force, partly by goodwill, the Roman power which ruled the earth and sea from the setting sun to the river Euphrates, and held it much more firmly and strongly than <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> had done, and he showed himself to be a king in spite of opposition, even though he did not accept the title. And, like <persName n="10">Alexander</persName>, he expired while planning new wars.

151 1 Their armies were equally zealous and devoted to both, and in battles they fought with the greatest ferocity, but were often disobedient and mutinous on account of the severity of their tasks. Yet they equally mourned and longed for their commanders when they were dead, and paid them divine honours. Both were well-formed and handsome in person, and both were descended from Jupiter, <persName n="10">Alexander</persName> through Aeacus and Hercules, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> through Anchises and Venus. Both were as prompt to fight their adversaries as they were ready to make peace and grant pardon to the vanquished, and after pardon to confer benefits; for they desired only to conquer.

Thus far let the parallel hold good, although they did not both start toward empire from the same footing; <persName n="10">Alexander</persName> from monarchy founded by <persName n="409">Philip</persName>, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> from a private station, being indeed well born and illustrious but wholly without wealth.

152 1 Both of them despised the prodigies relating to themselves, but they did not deal harshly with the soothsayers who predicted their death; for more than once the very same prodigies confronted both, pointing to the same end. Twice in the case of each the victims were without a lobe to the liver, and the first time it indicated a dangerous risk. It happened to <persName n="10">Alexander</persName> when he was among the Oxydracae and while he was leading his Macedonians in scaling the enemy's wall. The ladder broke, leaving him alone on the top. Taking counsel of his courage, he leaped inside the town against his enemies, and was struck severely in the breast and on the neck by a very heavy club, so that he fell down, and was rescued with difficulty by the Macedonians, who broke down the gates in their alarm for him. It happened to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> in Spain while his army was in great fear of the younger <persName n="221">Gnaeus Pompey</persName>, and hesitated to join battle. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> dashed in advance of all into the space between the armies, and received 200 darts on his shield until his army, moved by shame and fear for his safety, rushed forward and rescued him. Thus in the case of each the first inauspicious victims presaged danger of death; the second presaged death itself. As <persName n="402">Peithagoras</persName>, the soothsayer, was inspecting the entrails, he told <persName n="29">Apollodorus</persName>, who was in fear of <persName n="10">Alexander</persName> and <persName n="229">Hephestion</persName>, not to be afraid of them, because they would both be out of the way very soon. <persName n="229">Hephestion</persName> died immediately, and <persName n="29">Apollodorus</persName>, being apprehensive lest some conspiracy exist against <persName n="10">Alexander</persName>, communicated the prophecy to him. <persName n="10">Alexander</persName> smiled, and asked <persName n="402">Peithagoras</persName> himself what the prodigy meant. When the latter replied that it meant fatality, he smiled again. Nevertheless, he commended <persName n="29">Apollodorus</persName> for his good-will and the soothsayer for his freedom of speech.

153 1 As <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was entering the Senate for the last time, as I have shortly before related, the same omens were observed, but he said, jestingly, that the same thing had happened to him in Spain. When the soothsayer replied that he was in danger then too, and that the omen was now more deadly, he yielded somewhat to the warning and sacrificed again, and continued to do so until he became vexed with the priests for delaying him, and went in and was murdered. The same kind of thing happened to <persName n="10">Alexander</persName>. As he was returning from India to Babylon with his army, and was nearing the latter place, the Chaldeans urged him to postpone his entrance for the present. He replied with the iambic verse, "He is the best prophet who can guess right."49 Again, the Chaldeans urged him not to march his army into the city while looking toward the setting sun, but to go around and enter facing the east. It is said that he yielded to this suggestion and started to go around, but being impeded by a lake and marshy ground, he disregarded this second prophecy also, and entered the city looking toward the west. Not long after entering he went down the Euphrates in a boat to the river Pallacotta, which takes its water from the Euphrates and carries it away in marshes and ponds and thus hinders the irrigation of the Assyrian country. While he was considering how he should dam this stream, and while he was sailing out to it for this purpose, it is said that he jeered at the Chaldeans because he had gone into Babylon and sailed out of it safely. But yet the moment he returned back to it he was to die. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> jeered at the prophecies in like manner, the soothsayer predicted the day of his death, saying that he shouldn't survive the Ides of March, and when the day came <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> mocked him, saying, "The Ides have come"; and yet the same day he died. Thus both alike made light of the prophecies concerning themselves, and were not angry at the soothsayers who uttered them, and yet they became the victims of the prophecies.50

154 1 Both were students of the science and arts51 of their own country, of Greece, and of foreign nations. As to those of India, <persName n="10">Alexander</persName> interrogated their Brahmins who seemed to be the astronomers and learned men of that country, like the Magi among the Persians. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> likewise interrogated the Egyptians while he was there restoring <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName> to the throne, by which means he made many improvements among the peaceful arts for the Romans. He changed the calendar, which was still in disorder by reason of the intercalary months till then in use, for the Romans reckoned the year by the moon. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> changed it to the sun's course, as the Egyptians reckoned it.52 It happened in his case that not one of the conspirators against him escaped, but all were brought to condign punishment by his adopted son, just as the murderers of <persName n="409">Philip</persName> were by <persName n="10">Alexander</persName>. How they were punished the succeeding books will show.

1 1 Thus was <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, who had been foremost in extending the Roman sway, slain by his enemies and buried by the people. All of his murderers were brought to punishment. How the most distinguished of them were punished this book and the next one will show, and the other civil wars waged by the Romans will likewise be included in them.

2 1 The Senate blamed <persName n="27">Antony</persName> for his funeral oration over <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, by which, chiefly, the people were incited to disregard the decree of amnesty lately passed, and to scour the city in order to fire the houses of the murderers. But he changed it from bad to good feeling toward himself by one capital stroke of policy. There was a certain pseudo-xxxx in Rome named <persName n="16">Amatius</persName>. He pretended to be a grandson of <persName n="602">Marius</persName>, and for this reason was very popular with the masses. Being, according to this pretence, a relative of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, he was pained beyond measure by the latter's death, and erected an altar on the site of his funeral pyre. He collected a band of reckless men and made himself a perpetual terror to the murderers. Some of these had fled from the city, and those who had accepted the command of provinces from <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself had gone away to take charge of the same, <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> to Cisalpine Gaul, <persName n="579">Trebonius</persName> to Western Asia Minor, and <persName n="567">Tillius Cimber</persName> to Bithynia. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, who were the special favourites of the Senate, had also been chosen by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> as governors for the following year, the former of Syria, and the latter of Macedonia. But being still city praetors, they [remained at Rome]1 necessarily, and in their official capacity they conciliated the colonists by various decrees, and among others by one enabling them to sell their allotments, the law hitherto forbidding the alienation of the land till the end of twenty years. 3 1 It was said that <persName n="16">Amatius</persName> was only waiting an opportunity to entrap <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>. On this rumour, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, making capital out of the plot, and using his consular authority, arrested <persName n="16">Amatius</persName> and boldly put him to death without a trial. The senators were astonished at this deed as an act of violence and contrary to law, but they readily condoned its expediency, because they thought that the situation of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> would never be safe without such boldness. The followers of <persName n="16">Amatius</persName>, and the plebeians generally, missing <persName n="16">Amatius</persName> and feeling indignation at the deed, and especially because it had been done by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, whom the people had honoured, determined that they would not be scorned in that way. With shouts they took possession of the forum, exclaiming violently against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and called on the magistrates to dedicate the altar in place of <persName n="16">Amatius</persName>, and to offer the first sacrifices on it to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. Having been driven out of the forum by soldiers sent by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, they became still more indignant, and vociferated more loudly, and some of them showed places where <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s statues had been torn from their pedestals. One man told them that he could show the shop where the statues were being broken up. The others followed, and having witnessed the fact, they set fire to the place. Finally, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> sent more soldiers and some of those who resisted were killed, others were captured, and of these the slaves were crucified and the freemen thrown over the Tarpeian rock.

4 1 So this tumult was quieted; but the extreme fondness of the plebeians for <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was turned into extreme hatred. The Senate was delighted, because it believed that it could not rest secure otherwise about <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and his associates. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> also moved that <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> (the son of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, who was still much beloved by all) should be recalled from Spain, where he was still attacked by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s lieutenants, and that he should be paid 50 millions of Attic drachmas out of the public treasury for his father's confiscated property and be appointed commander of the sea, as his father had been, with charge of all the Roman ships, wherever situated, which were needed for immediate service. The astonished Senate accepted each of these decrees with alacrity and applauded <persName n="27">Antony</persName> the whole day; for nobody, in their estimation, was more devoted to the republic than the elder <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, and hence nobody was more regretted. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, who were of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s faction, and most honoured by all at that time, thought that they would be entirely safe. They thought that what they had done would be confirmed, and the republic be at last restored, and their party successful. Wherefore <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> praised <persName n="27">Antony</persName> continually, and the Senate, perceiving that the plebeians were making plots against him on its account, allowed him a guard for his personal safety, chosen by himself from the veterans who were sojourning in the city.

5 1 <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, either because he had done everything for this very purpose, or seizing the happy chance as very useful to him, enlisted his guard and kept adding to it till it amounted to 6000. They were not common soldiers. He thought that he should easily get the latter when he needed them otherwise. These were composed wholly of centurions, as being fit for command, and of long experience in war, and his own acquaintances through his service under <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. He appointed tribunes over them, chosen from their own number and adorned with military decoration, and these he held in honour and made sharers of such of his plans as he made known. The Senate began to be suspicious of the number of his guards, and of his care in choosing them, and advised him to reduce them to a moderate number so as to avoid invidious remarks. He promised to do so as soon as the disorder among the plebeians should be quieted. It had been decreed that all the things done by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and all that he intended to do, should be ratified. The memoranda of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s intentions were in <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s possession, and <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s secretary, <persName n="158">Faberius</persName>, was obedient to him in every way since <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself, on the point of his departure, had placed all petitions of this kind in <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s discretion. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> made many additions in order to secure the favour of many persons. He made gifts to cities, to princes, and to his own guards, and although all were advised that these were <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s memoranda, yet the recipients knew that the favour was due to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. In the same way he enrolled many new names in the list of senators and did many other things to please the Senate, in order that it might not bear him ill-will in reference to his guards.

6 1 While <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was busy with these matters, <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, seeing nobody among either the plebeians or the veterans inclined to be at peace with them, and considering that any other person might lay plots against them like that of <persName n="16">Amatius</persName>, became distrustful of the fickleness of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who now had an army under his command, and seeing that the republic, too, was not confirmed by deeds, they suspected <persName n="27">Antony</persName> for that reason also; and so they reposed most confidence in <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, who had three legions near by, and also sent secretly to <persName n="579">Trebonius</persName> in Asia and to <persName n="567">Tillius Cimber</persName> in Bithynia, asking them to collect money quietly and to prepare an army. They were anxious, too, themselves to enter upon the government of the provinces assigned to them by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, but as the time for doing so had not yet come, they thought that it would be indecorous for them to leave their service as city praetors unfinished, and that they would incur the suspicions of an undue longing for power over the provinces. They preferred, nevertheless, to spend the remainder of their year as private citizens somewhere, as a matter of necessity, rather than serve as praetors in the city where they were not safe, and were not held in honour corresponding to the benefits they had conferred upon their country. While they were in this state of mind, the Senate, holding the same opinion as themselves, gave them charge of the supply of corn for the city from all parts of the world, until the time should arrive for them to take command of their provinces.

This was done in order that <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> might not at any time seem to have run away. So great was the anxiety and regard for them that the Senate cared for the other murderers chiefly on their account. 7 1 After <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> had left the city, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, being in possession of something like monarchical power, cast about for the government of a province and an army for himself. He desired that of Syria most of all, but he was not ignorant of the fact that he was under suspicion and that he would be more so if he should ask for it; for the Senate had secretly encouraged <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, the other consul, to oppose <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, as he had always been at variance with him. <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, knowing that this young <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> was himself ambitious, persuaded him to solicit the province of Syria and the army enlisted against the Parthians, to be used against the Parthians, in place of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, and to ask it, not from the Senate, which had not the power to grant it, but from the people by a law. <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> was delighted, and immediately brought forward the law. The Senate accused him of nullifying the decrees of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. He replied that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had not assigned the war against the Parthians to anybody, and that <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, who had been assigned to the command of Syria, had himself been the first to alter the decrees of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> by authorizing colonists to sell their allotments before the expiration of the legal period of twenty years. He said also it would be an indignity to himself if he, <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, were not chosen for Syria instead of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>. The Senate then persuaded one of the tribunes, named <persName n="56">Asprenas</persName>, to give a false report of the signs in the sky during the comitia, having some hope that <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, too, who was both consul and augur, and was supposed to be still at variance with <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, would co-operate with him. But when the voting came on, and <persName n="56">Asprenas</persName> said that the signs in the sky were unfavourable, as it was not his business to attend to this, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, angry at his lying, ordered that the tribes should go on with the voting on the subject of <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>.

8 1 Thus <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> became governor of Syria and general of the war against the Parthians and of the forces enlisted for that purpose by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, together with those that had gone in advance to Macedonia. Then it became known for the first time that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was co-operating with <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>. After this business had been transacted by the people, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> solicited the province of Macedonia from the Senate, well knowing that after Syria had been given to <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, they would be ashamed to deny Macedonia to himself, especially as it was a province without an army. They gave it to him unwillingly, at the same time wondering why <persName n="27">Antony</persName> should let <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> have the army, but glad nevertheless that the latter had it rather than the former. They themselves took the opportunity to ask of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> other provinces for <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, and there were assigned to them Cyrenaica and Crete; or, as some say, both of these to <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and Bithynia to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>.

9 1 Such was the state of affairs at Rome. We turn now to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>,2 the son of the daughter of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s sister, who had been appointed master of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s horse for one year, for <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> at times made this a yearly office, passing it among his friends. Being still a young man, he had been sent by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> to Apollonia on the Adriatic to be educated and trained in the art of war, so that he might accompany <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> on his expeditions. Troops of horse from Macedonia were sent to him by turns for the purpose of drill, and certain army officers visited him frequently as a relative of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. As he received all with kindness, an acquaintance and good feeling grew up by means of them between himself and the army. At the end of a six months' sojourn in Apollonia, it was announced to him one evening that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had been killed in the senate-house by those who were dearest to him, and were then his most powerful subordinates. As the rest of the story was untold he was overcome by fear, not knowing whether the deed had been committed by the Senate as a whole or was confined to the immediate actors; nor whether the majority of the Senate had already punished them, or were actually accomplices, or whether the people were pleased with what had been done.

10 1 Thereupon his friends in Rome advised as follows:3 some urged him to take refuge with the army in Macedonia to ensure his personal safety, and when he should learn that the murder was only a private transaction to take courage against his enemies and avenge <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>; and there were high officers who promised to protect him if he would come. But his mother and his stepfather, <persName n="410">Philippus</persName>, wrote to him from Rome not to be too confident and not to attempt anything rash, but to bear in mind what <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, after conquering every enemy, had suffered at the hands of his closest friends; that it would be safer under present circumstances to choose a private life and hasten to them at Rome, but with caution. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> yielded to them because he did not know what had happened after <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s death. He took leave of the army officers and crossed the Adriatic, not to Brundusium (for as he had made no test of the army at that place he avoided all risk), but to another town not far from it and out of the direct route, named Lupiae. There he took lodgings and remained for a while.

11 1 When more accurate information about the murder and the public grief had reached him, together with copies of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s will and the decrees of the Senate, his relatives still more cautioned him to beware of the enemies of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, as he was the latter's adopted son and heir. They even advised him to renounce the adoption, together with the inheritance. But he thought that to do so, and not to avenge <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, would be disgraceful. So he went to Brundusium, first sending in advance to see that none of the murderers had laid any trap for him. When the army there advanced to meet him, and received him as <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s son, he took courage, offered sacrifice, and immediately assumed the name of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>; for it is customary among the Romans for the adopted son to take the name of the adoptive father. He not only assumed it, but he changed his own name and his patronymic completely, calling himself xxxx the son of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, instead of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> the son of <persName n="390">Octavius</persName>, and he continued to do so ever after. Directly multitudes of men from all sides flocked to him as <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s son, some from friendship to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, others his freedmen and slaves, and with them soldiers besides, who were either engaged in conveying supplies and money to the army in Macedonia, or bringing other money and tribute from other countries to Brundusium.

12 1 Encouraged by the numbers who were joining him, and by the glory of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and by the good-will of all toward himself, he journeyed to Rome with a notable crowd which, like a torrent, grew larger and larger each day. Although he was safe from any open attacks by reason of the multitude surrounding him, he was all the more on his guard against secret ones, because almost all of those accompanying him were new acquaintances. Some of the towns were not altogether favourable to him, but <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s veterans, who had been distributed in colonies, flocked from their settlements to greet the young man. They bewailed <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and cursed <persName n="27">Antony</persName> for not proceeding against the monstrous crime, and said that they would avenge it if anybody would lead them. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> praised them, but postponed the matter for the present and sent them away. When he had arrived at Tarracina, about 400 stades from Rome, he received news that <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> had been deprived of Syria and Macedonia by the consuls, and had received the smaller provinces of Cyrenaica and Crete by way of compensation; that certain exiles had returned; that <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> had been recalled; that some new members had been added to the Senate in accordance with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s memoranda, and that many other things were happening.

13 1 When he arrived at the city his mother and <persName n="410">Philippus</persName> and the others who were interested in him were anxious about the estrangement of the Senate from <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and the decree that his murderers should not be punished, and the contempt shown him by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who was then all-powerful, and had neither gone to meet <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s son when he was coming nor sent anybody to him. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> quieted their fears, saying that he would call on <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, as the younger man on the older and the private citizen on the consul, and that he would show proper respect for the Senate. As for the decree, he said that it had been passed because nobody had prosecuted the murderers; whenever anybody should have courage to prosecute, the people and the Senate would lend their aid to him as enforcing the law, and the gods would do so for the justice of the cause, and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> himself equally. If he (<persName n="61">Augustus</persName>) should reject the inheritance and the adoption, he would be false to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and would wrong the people who had a share in the will.

As he was finishing his remarks he burst out that honour demanded that he should not only incur danger, but even death, after he had been preferred before all others in this way by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, he would show himself worthy of one who had himself braved every danger. Then he repeated the words of Achilles, which were then fresh in his mind, turning to his mother as if she were Thetis;—

"Would I might die this hour, who failed to save

My comrade slain!"4

After saying this he added that these words of Achilles, and especially the deed that followed, had of all things given him immortal renown; and he invoked <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> not as a friend, but a father; not as a fellow-soldier, but a commander-in‑chief; not as one who had fallen by the law of war, but as the victim of sacrilegious murder in the senate-house.

14 1 Thereupon his mother's anxiety was changed to joy, and she embraced him as alone worthy of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. She checked his speaking and urged him to prosecute his designs with the favour of fortune. She advised him, however, to use art and patience rather than open boldness. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> approved of this policy and promised to adopt it in action, and forthwith sent around to his friends the same evening, asking them to come to the forum early in the morning and bring a crowd with them. There presenting himself to <persName n="178">Gaius Antonius</persName>, the brother of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who was the city praetor, he said that he accepted the adoption of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>; for it is a Roman custom that adoptions are confirmed by witnesses before the praetors. When the public scribes had taken down his declaration, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> went from the forum straightway to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. The latter was in the gardens that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had given to him, which had formerly been <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s. As <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was kept waiting at the vestibule for some time, he interpreted the fact as a sign of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s displeasure, but when he was admitted there were greetings and mutual inquiries proper to the occasion.

When the time came to speak of the business in hand, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> said: 15 1 "Father <persName n="27">Antony</persName> (for the benefits that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> conferred upon you and your gratitude toward him warrant me in giving you that title), for some of the things that you have done since his death I praise you and owe you thanks; for others I blame you. I shall speak freely of what my sorrow prompts me to speak. When <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was killed you were not present, as the murderers detained you at the door; otherwise you would have saved him or incurred the danger of sharing the same fate with him. If the latter would have befallen you, then it is well that you were not present. When certain senators proposed rewards to the murderers as tyrannicides you strongly opposed them. For this I give you hearty thanks, although you knew that they intended to kill you also;5 not as I think, because you were likely to avenge <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, but, as they themselves say, lest you should be his successor in the tyranny. Slayers of a 'tyrant' they may or may not have been; murderers they certainly were;6 and that is why they took refuge in the Capitol, either as guilty suppliants in a temple or as enemies in a fortress. How then could they have obtained amnesty and impunity for their crime unless some portion of the Senate and people had been corrupted by them? Yet you, as consul, ought to have seen what would be for the interest of the majority, and if you had wished to avenge such a monstrous crime, or to reclaim the erring, your office would have enabled you to do either. But you sent hostages from your own family to the murderers at the Capitol for their security.

"Let us suppose that those who had been corrupted forced you to do this also, yet when <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s will had been read, and you had yourself delivered your righteous funeral oration, and the people, being thus brought to a lively remembrance of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, had carried firebrands to the houses of the murderers, agreeing to come back armed the next day, why did you not co-operate with them and lead them with fire or arms? Or why did you not bring them to trial, if trial was necessary for men seen in the act of murder — you, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s friend; you, the consul: you, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>?

16 1 "<persName n="16">Amatius</persName> was put to death by your order in the plenitude of your authority, but you connived at the escape of the murderers, some of whom have passed on to the provinces which they nefariously hold as gifts at the hands of him whom they slew. These things were no sooner done than you and <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, the consuls, proceeded, very properly, to strip them and possess yourself of Syria and Macedonia. I should have owed you thanks for this also, had you not immediately voted them Cyrenaica and Crete; had you not preferred these fugitives for governorships, where they can always defend themselves against me, and had you not tolerated <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> in the command of Hither Gaul, although he, like the rest, was one of my father's slayers. It may be said that these were decrees of the Senate. But you put the vote and you presided over the Senate — you who ought most of all to have opposed them on your own account. To grant amnesty to the murderers was merely to insure their personal safety as a matter of favour, but to vote them provinces and rewards forthwith was to insult <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and annul your own judgment.

"Grief has compelled me to speak these words, against the rules of decorum perhaps, considering my youth and the respect I owe you. They have been spoken, however, as to a more fully declared friend of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, to one who was invested by him with the greatest honour and power, and who would have been adopted by him no doubt if he had known that you would accept kinship with the family of Aeneas in exchange for that of Hercules; this created7 doubt in his mind when he was thinking strongly of designating you as his successor.

17 1 "For the future, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, I conjure you by the gods who preside over friendship, and by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself, to change somewhat the measures that have been adopted, for you can change them if you wish to; if not, that you will in any case hereafter aid and co-operate with me in punishing the murderers, with the help of the people and of those who are still my father's faithful friends, and if you still have regard for the conspirators and the Senate, do not be hard on us. Enough of this topic. You know about my private affairs and the expense I must incur for the legacy which my father directed to be given to the people, and the haste involved in it lest I may seem churlish by reason of delay, and lest those who have been assigned to colonies be compelled to remain in the city and waste their time on my account. Of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s movables, that were brought immediately after the murder from his house to yours as a safer place, I beg you to take keepsakes and anything else by way of ornament and whatever you like to retain from us. But in order that I may pay the legacy to the people, please give me the gold coin that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had collected for his intended wars. That will suffice for the distribution to 300,000 men now. For the rest of my expenses I may perhaps borrow from you, if I may be so bold, or from the public treasury on your security, if you will give it, and I will offer my own property for sale at once."

18 1 While <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was speaking in this fashion <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was astonished at his freedom of speech and his boldness, which seemed much beyond the bounds of propriety and of his years. He was offended by the words because they were wanting in the respect due to him, and still more by the demand for money, and, accordingly, he replied in these somewhat severe terms: "Young man, if <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> left you the government, together with the inheritance and his name, it is proper for you to ask and for me to give the reasons for my public acts. But if the Roman people never surrendered the government to anybody to dispose of in succession, not even when they had kings, whom they expelled and swore never to have any more (this was the very charge that the murderers brought against your father, saying that they killed him because he was no longer a leader but a king), then there is no need of my answering you as to my public acts. For the same reason I release you from any indebtedness to me in the way of gratitude for those acts. They were performed not for your sake, but for the people's, except in one particular, which was of the greatest importance to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and to yourself. For if, to secure my own safety and to shield myself from enmity, I had allowed honours to be voted to the murderers as tyrannicides, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> would have been declared a tyrant, to whom neither glory, nor any kind of honour, nor confirmation of his acts would have been possible; who could make no valid will, have no son, no property, nor any burial of his body, even as a private citizen. The laws provide that the bodies of tyrants shall be cast out unburied, their memory stigmatized, and their property confiscated.

19 1 "Apprehending all of these consequences, I entered the lists for <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, for his immortal honour, and his public funeral, not without danger, not without incurring hatred to myself, contending against hot-headed, blood-thirsty men, who, as you know, had already conspired to kill me; and against the Senate, which was displeased with your father on account of his usurped authority. But I willingly chose to incur these dangers and to suffer anything rather than allow <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> to remain unburied and dishonoured — the most valiant man of his time, the most fortunate in every respect, and the one to whom the highest honours were due from me. It is by reason of the dangers I incurred that you enjoy your present distinction as the successor of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, his family, his name, his dignity, his wealth. It would have been more becoming in you to testify your gratitude to me for these things than to reproach me for concessions made to soothe the Senate, or in compensation for what I needed from it, or in pursuance of other needs or reasons — you a younger man addressing an older one.

"But enough of that. You hint that I am ambitious of the leadership. I am not ambitious of it, although I do not consider myself unworthy of it. You think that I am distressed because I was not mentioned in <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s will, though you agree with me that the family of the Heraclidae is enough to content one.

20 1 "As to your pecuniary needs and your wishing to borrow from the public funds, I might have thought you must be jesting, had it not been possible to think that you are still ignorant of the fact that the public treasury was left empty by your father; because after he assumed the government the public revenues were brought to him instead of to the treasury, and they will presently be found among <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s assets when we vote an investigation into these matters. For such investigation will not be unjust to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> now that he is dead, nor would he say that it was unjust if he were living and were asked for the accounts. And as there will be many private persons to dispute with you concerning single pieces of property, you may assume that this portion will not be uncontested. The money transferred to my house was not so large a sum as you conjecture, nor is any part of it in my custody now. The men in power and authority, except <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> and my brothers, divided up the whole of it straightway as the property of a tyrant, but were brought round by me to support the decrees in favour of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and you, if you are wise, when you get possession of the remainder, will distribute it among those who are disaffected toward you rather than among the people. The former, if they are wise, will send the people, who are to be colonized, away to their settlements. The people, however, as you ought to have learned from the Greek studies you have been lately pursuing, are as unstable as the waves of the sea, now advancing, now retreating. In like manner, among us also, the people are for ever exalting their favourites, and casting them down again."

21 1 Feeling outraged by the many insulting things said by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> went away invoking his father repeatedly by name, and offered for sale all the property which had come to him by the inheritance, at the same time endeavouring by this zeal to induce the people to stand by him. While this hasty action made manifest <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s enmity toward him, and the Senate voted an immediate investigation of the public accounts, most people grew apprehensive of the young <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> on account of the favour in which his father was held by the soldiers and the plebeians, and on account of his own present popularity based on the expected distribution of the money, and by reason of the wealth which had fallen to him in such vast measure that in the opinion of many he would not restrict himself to the rank of a private citizen. But they were most apprehensive of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, lest he should bring the young <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, distinguished and rich as he was, under his own control, and grasp the sovereignty held by the elder <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. Others were delighted with the present state of affairs, believing that the two men would come into conflict with each other; and that the investigation concerning the public money would presently put an end to the wealth of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and that the treasury would be filled thereby, because the greater part of the public property would be found in <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s estate.

22 1 In the meantime many persons brought lawsuits against <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> for the recovery of landed property, some making one claim and some another, differing in other respects, but for the most part having this in common, that it had been confiscated from persons who had been banished or put to death owing to the proscription. These suits were brought before Antonius himself or the other consul, <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>. If any were brought before other magistrates, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was everywhere worsted for the most part through <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s influence, although he showed by the public records that the purchases8 had been made by his father, and that the last decree of the Senate had confirmed all of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s acts. Great wrongs were done him in these judgments, and the losses in consequence thereof were going on without end, until <persName n="401">Pedius</persName> and <persName n="413">Pinarius</persName>, who had a certain portion of the inheritance under <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s will, complained to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, both for himself and for <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, that they were suffering injustice in violation of the Senate's decree. They thought that he ought to annul only the things done to insult <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and to ratify all that had been done by him.

<persName n="27">Antony</persName> acknowledged that his course was perhaps somewhat contrary to the agreements noted. The decrees also, he said, had been recorded in a sense different from the original understanding. While it was the amnesty alone which was urgent, the clause "that nothing previously resolved be repealed" was added not for the sake of this provision in itself, nor because it was entirely satisfactory in all matters of detail, but rather to promote good order and to quiet the people, who had been thrown into tumult by these events. It would be more just, he added, to observe the spirit than the letter of the decree, and not to make an unseemly opposition to so many men who had lost their own and their ancestors' property in the civil convulsions, and to do this in favour of a young man who had received an amount of other people's wealth disproportionate to a private station and beyond his hopes, and who was not making good use of his fortune, but employing it in the rashest adventures. He would take care of them (<persName n="401">Pedius</persName> and <persName n="413">Pinarius</persName>) after their portion should have been separated from that of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. This was the answer made by <persName n="27">Antony</persName> to <persName n="401">Pedius</persName> and <persName n="413">Pinarius</persName>. So they took their portion immediately, in order not to lose their own share by the lawsuits, and they did this not so much on their own account as on that of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, for they were going to bestow the whole of it upon him soon afterward.

23 1 The games were now approaching, which <persName n="178">Gaius Antonius</persName>, the brother of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, was about to give in behalf of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, the praetor, as he attended also to the other duties of the praetorship which devolved on him in the latter's absence. Lavish expense was incurred in the preparations for them, in the hope that the people, gratified by the spectacle, would recall <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, on the other hand, trying to win the mob over to his own side, distributed the money derived from the sale of his property among the head men of the tribes by turns, to be divided by them among the first comers, and went round to the places where his property was on sale and ordered the auctioneers to announce the lowest possible price for everything, both on account of the uncertainty and danger of the lawsuits still pending, and on account of his own haste; all of which acts brought him both popularity and sympathy as one undeserving of such treatment. When in addition to what he had received as <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s heir, he offered for sale his own property derived from his father <persName n="390">Octavius</persName>, and whatever he had from other sources, and all that belonged to his mother and to <persName n="410">Philippus</persName>, and the share of <persName n="401">Pedius</persName> and <persName n="413">Pinarius</persName> which he begged from them, in order to make the distribution to the people (because in consequence of the litigation <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s property was not sufficient even for this purpose), then the people considered it no longer the gift of the elder <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, but of the younger one, and they commiserated him deeply and praised him both for what he endured and for what he aspired to be. It was evident that they would not long tolerate the insult that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was doing him.

24 1 They showed their feelings clearly while <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>' games were in progress, lavish as these were. Although a certain number, who had been hired for the purpose, shouted that <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> should be recalled, and the rest of the spectators were thus wrought up to a feeling of pity for them, crowds ran in and stopped the games until they checked the demand for their recall.

When <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> learned that <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had frustrated what they had hoped to obtain from the games, they decided to go to Syria and Macedonia, which had been theirs before these provinces were voted to <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and to seize them by force. When their intentions became known, <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> hastened to Syria, taking the province of Asia in his way in order to collect money there. <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, thinking that he should soon need troops for his own purposes, conceived the idea of transferring to himself the army in Macedonia, which was composed of the very best material and was of large size (it consisted of six legions, besides a great number of archers and light-armed troops, much cavalry, and a corresponding amount of apparatus of all kinds), although it properly belonged to <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, who had been entrusted with Syria and the war against the Parthians, because <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was about to use these forces against the Parthians. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> wanted it especially because it was close at hand, and, by crossing the Adriatic, could be thrown at once into Italy.

25 1 Suddenly a rumour burst forth upon them that the Getae, learning of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s death, had made an incursion into Macedonia and were ravaging it. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> asked the Senate to give him an army in order to punish them, saying that this army had been prepared by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> to be used against the Getae before marching against the Parthians, and that everything was now quiet on the Parthian frontier. The Senate distrusted the rumour, and sent messengers to make inquiry. <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, in order to dissipate their fear and suspicion, proposed a decree that it should not be lawful for anybody, for any cause whatever, to vote for a dictatorship, or to accept it if offered. If anybody should disregard any of these provisions, he might be killed with impunity by anybody who should meet him. Having deceived the Senate9 chiefly by this means, and having agreed with the friends of <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> to give him one legion, he was chosen absolute commander of the forces in Macedonia; and then when he had obtained what he desired, he sent his brother Gaius with haste to communicate the decree of the Senate to the army. Those who had been sent to inquire into the rumour came back and reported that they had seen no Getae in Macedonia, but they added, either truthfully, or because they were instructed to do so by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, that it was feared that they would make an incursion into Macedonia if the army were withdrawn.

26 1 While these things were taking place at Rome, <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> were collecting troops and money, and <persName n="579">Trebonius</persName>, governor of the province of Asia, was fortifying his towns for them. When <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> arrived, <persName n="579">Trebonius</persName> would not admit him to Pergamus or Smyrna, but allowed him, as consul, an opportunity of buying provisions outside the walls. However, when he attacked the walls with fury, but accomplished nothing, <persName n="579">Trebonius</persName> said that he would be admitted to Ephesus. <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> started for Ephesus forthwith, and <persName n="579">Trebonius</persName> sent a force to follow him at a certain distance. While these were observing <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>'s march, they were overtaken by night, and, having no further suspicions, returned to Smyrna, leaving a few of their number to follow him. <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> laid an ambush for this small number, captured and killed them, and went back the same night to Smyrna. Finding it unguarded, he took it by escalade.

<persName n="579">Trebonius</persName>, who was captured in bed, told his captors to lead the way to <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, saying that he was willing to follow them. One of the centurions answered him facetiously, "Go where you please, but you must leave your head behind here, for we are ordered to bring your head, not yourself." With these words the centurion immediately cut off his head, and early in the morning <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> ordered it to be displayed on the praetor's chair where <persName n="579">Trebonius</persName> was accustomed to transact public business. Since <persName n="579">Trebonius</persName> had participated in the murder of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> by detaining <persName n="27">Antony</persName> in conversation at the door of the Senate-house while the others killed him, the soldiers and camp-followers fell upon the rest of his body with fury and treated it with every kind of indignity. They rolled his head from one to another in sport along the city pavements like a ball till it was completely crushed. This was the first of the murderers who received the meed of his crime, and thus vengeance overtook him.

Vol. IV
1 <persName n="27">Antony</persName> conceived the idea of bringing his army from Macedonia to Italy; and being in want of any other pretext for this step he asked the Senate to let him exchange the province of Macedonia for that of Cisalpine Gaul, which was under the command of <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>. He remembered that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had marched from the latter province when he overthrew <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and he thought that he should appear to be transferring his army to Gaul and not only to Italy. The Senate, which looked upon Cisalpine Gaul as its own fortress, was angry, and now, for the first time perceived the stratagem and repented having given him Macedonia. The principal members sent word privately to <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> to keep a strong hold on his province, and to raise additional troops and money in case <persName n="27">Antony</persName> should resort to violence, so much did they fear and hate the latter. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> then bethought him to ask the people, instead of the Senate, for this province by a law in the same manner that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had obtained it at a former time, and <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> had recently obtained Syria. In order to intimidate the Senate he ordered his brother, <persName n="178">Gaius Antonius</persName>, to bring his army across the Adriatic to Brundusium.

28 1 <persName n="178">Gaius Antonius</persName> proceeded to do as ordered. Meanwhile there had arrived the time for the games which the aedile <persName n="135">Critonius</persName> was about to exhibit, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> made preparations to display his father's gilded throne and garland, which the Senate had voted should be placed in front of him at all games. When <persName n="135">Critonius</persName> said that he could not allow <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> to be honoured in this way at games given at his expense, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> brought him before <persName n="27">Antony</persName> as consul. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> said he would refer the matter to the Senate. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was vexed and said, "Refer it; I will place the throne there as long as the decree is in force." <persName n="27">Antony</persName> became angry and prohibited it. He prohibited it still more unreasonably in the next games given by <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> himself, which had been instituted by his father in honour of Venus Genetrix when he dedicated a temple to her in a forum, together with that forum itself. Then at last it became evident that universal hatred of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was already growing out of this affair, since he seemed to be moved not so much by a feeling of rivalry toward the younger <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> as by an ungrateful purpose to insult the memory of the elder one.

<persName n="61">Augustus</persName> himself, with a crowd of people like a body-guard, moved about among the plebeians and those who had received benefits from his father, or had served under him in war, stirring the anger and beseeching them to pay no attention to himself, though the victim of so many and so great outrages, and to ignore him, by his own request, but to defend <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, their commander and benefactor, against the insults of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>; to defend themselves too, because they would never be secure in what they had received from <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> unless the decrees passed in his honour should remain in full force. He exclaimed against <persName n="27">Antony</persName> everywhere throughout the city, leaping up on to any elevated spot, saying, "O <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, do not be angry with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> on my account. Do not insult one who has been the greatest benefactor to you. On me heap indignities to your heart's content. Cease plundering his property until the legacy to the citizens is paid; then take all the rest. However poor I may be, my father's glory, if that remains, and the distribution to the people, if you will allow it to be made, will be all-sufficient for me."

29 1 Henceforth there were open and repeated outcries against <persName n="27">Antony</persName> on all sides. The latter indulged in more bitter threats against <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and when they became known the people were still more incensed against him. The tribunes of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s guard, who had served under the elder <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and who were then in the highest favour with <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, urged him to refrain from insult, both on their account and on his own, as he had served under <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and had obtained his present good fortune at <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s hands. <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, recognizing the truth of these words, and feeling a sense of shame before those who uttered them and needing some help from <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> himself with the people, to procure the exchange of provinces, agreed with what they said and swore that what he had done had been quite contrary to his intention, but that he changed his purpose because the young man was inordinately puffed up, being still a youth and showing no respect for his elders and no honour for those in authority. Although for his own benefit the young man still needed reproof, yet in deference to their remonstrances he would restrain his anger and return to his former disposition and intention, if <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, also, would curb his presumption.

30 1 The tribunes were delighted with this reply and they brought <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> together, who, after some mutual chiding, formed an alliance. The law concerning Cisalpine Gaul was proposed at once to the great dismay of the senators. They intended, if <persName n="27">Antony</persName> should first bring the law before them, to reject it, and if he should bring it before the popular assembly without consulting them, to send the tribunes of the people to veto it. There were some who advised that this province be made free altogether, so much was it dreaded on account of its nearness. <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, on the other hand, accused them of entrusting it to <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> because he had been one of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s murderers and of having no confidence in himself because he had not joined in killing the man who had subdued the province and brought it to its knees10 — throwing out these insinuations openly against all of his opponents, as persons who rejoiced over the assassination. When the day for the comitia came the Senate expected that the people would be summoned by centuries, but the Antonians, who had enclosed the forum with a rope during the night summoned them by tribes according to a plan they had agreed upon.11 Although the plebeians were incensed against <persName n="27">Antony</persName> they nevertheless co-operated with him for the sake of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, who stood alongside the rope and begged them to do so. He did this in order that <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, who had been one of his father's murderers, might not have the government of so convenient a province, and of the army belonging to it, and, moreover, to gratify <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who was now in league with him. He expected also to get some assistance from <persName n="27">Antony</persName> in return. The tribunes, too, had been corrupted with money by <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and remained silent. So the law was passed and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> now with plausible reason began to bring his army across the Adriatic.

31 1 One of the tribunes of the people having died <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> favoured the election of <persName n="166">Flaminius</persName> as his successor. The people thought that he was ambitious of this office for himself, but that he refrained from being a candidate because he was under age, and accordingly, they proposed to cast their votes for him for tribune. The Senate begrudged him this increase of power, fearing lest, as tribune, he should bring the murderers of his father before the popular assembly for trial. <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, in disregard of his recent alliance with <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, either to curry favour with the Senate, or to appease its dissatisfaction with the law respecting Cisalpine Gaul, or for private reasons, gave public notice, as consul, that <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> should not attempt anything contrary to law; and that if he should do so he (<persName n="27">Antony</persName>) would use the full measure of his authority against him. As this edict was an act of ingratitude toward <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and was insulting both to him and to the people, the latter were extremely angry and took steps to defeat <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s wishes in the election, so that he became alarmed and annulled the comitia, saying that the remaining number of tribunes was sufficient. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, thus at last openly attacked, sent numerous agents to the towns colonized by his father to tell how he had been treated and to learn the state of feeling in each. He also sent certain persons in the guise of traders into <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s camp to mingle with the soldiers, to work upon the boldest of them, and secretly distribute handbills among the rank and file.

32 1 While <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was doing this the military tribunes again sought an audience with <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and addressed him thus: "We, O <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and the others who served with you under <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, established his rule and continued to maintain it from day to day as its faithful supporters. We know how his murderers equally hate and conspire against us and how the Senate favours them. But after the people drove them out we took fresh courage seeing that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s acts were not altogether without friends, were not forgotten, were not unappreciated. For our future security we put our trust in you, the friend of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, after him the most experienced of all as a commander, our present leader, and the one most fit to be such. Our enemies are starting up afresh. They are forcibly seizing Syria and Macedonia and are raising money and troops against us. The Senate is stirring up <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> against you. Yet you are wasting your powers of mind in a disagreement with the young <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. We naturally fear lest there be added to the war, which has not yet broken out but which is imminent, dissensions among you, which shall accomplish all that our enemies desire against us. We beseech you to consider these things for the sake of piety toward <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and care for us, who have never given you cause for complaint, for your own interest even more than ours; and, while you still may, to assist <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> at any rate so far — for this will suffice — as to punish the murderers. Then you will enjoy your power without anxiety and will provide security for us, who are now apprehensive both for ourselves and for you."

33 1 To the tribunes who had thus spoken <persName n="27">Antony</persName> made the following reply: "What friendship and zeal I had for <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> while he lived, what dangers I braved in his service, you, who have been my fellow-soldiers and the sharers in those events, know full well. What favours he showed me, what honours he continually bestowed upon me, it does not become me to say. The murderers, too, were acquainted with these facts. They conspired to kill me with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> because they knew that if I were living they could not compass their designs. Whoever dissuaded them from that purpose did so not from regard for my safety, but to preserve the appearance of tyrannicide, so that they might not seem to be killing a number of persons as enemies, but only one as a despot. Who, then, will believe that I have no care for <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, who was my benefactor, that I prefer his enemies, and that I willingly condone his murder at the hands of those who conspired against me also, as the young <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> imagines? Whence came their amnesty, whence their preferment? For he wishes to charge these things upon me instead of the Senate. Learn from me how they came about.

34 1 "When <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was suddenly slain in the senate-house fear fell upon me most of all by reason of my friendship for him and my ignorance of the facts, as I knew not yet the particulars of the conspiracy nor against how many it was designed. The people were terror-stricken. The murderers with a body of gladiators took possession of the Capitol and shut themselves up in it. The Senate was on their side, just as it now is more openly, and was about to vote rewards to them as tyrannicides. If <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had been declared a tyrant then might we all have perished as the friends of a tyrant. In the midst of such confusion, anxiety, and fear, when it was not the time either for any rash move, or for any long hesitation,12 you will find, if you examine, that where courage was needed I was boldest and where artifice was required I was most crafty. The first thing to be done, because it embraced everything else, was to prevent the voting of rewards to the conspirators. This I accomplished against the strong opposition of the Senate and of the murderers, with unfailing courage and in the face of danger, because I then believed that we of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s party could be safe only in case <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> were not declared a tyrant. But when I saw our enemies, and the Senate itself, plunged alike in fear (lest, if <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> were not decreed a tyrant, they themselves should be convicted of murder), and making their fight for this reason, I yielded and granted amnesty instead of rewards to the murderers, in order to gain what I wanted in exchange. What number of things did I want and how important were they? That <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s name, to me most dear, should not be blotted out, that the adoption on which this young man prides himself should not be annulled, that the will should not be declared invalid, that his body should have a royal funeral, that the immortal honours previously decreed to him should be fulfilled, that all his acts should be confirmed, and that his son, and we his friends, both generals and soldiers, should remain in perfect safety and enjoy a life of honour instead of ignominy.

35 1 "Think you that I asked few or small things from the Senate in exchange for the amnesty, or that the Senate would have made these concessions without the amnesty? If this exchange had been made in all sincerity it would have been a fair bargain actually to spare the murderers for the sake of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s immortal glory and our complete security, but in fact I did it not with that intention, but in order to postpone the retribution. Accordingly, as soon as I had obtained what I wanted from the Senate, and the murderers, freed from anxiety, were off their guard, I took fresh courage and undermined the amnesty, not by votes, not by decrees (for that was impossible), but by working on the people imperceptibly. I brought <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s body into the forum under pretence of burial, laid bare his wounds, I showed the number of them and his clothing all bloody and slashed. In public speech I dwelt on his bravery and his services to the common people in pathetic terms, weeping for him as slain but invoking him as god. These acts and words of mine stirred up the people, kindled a fire after the amnesty, sent them against the houses of our enemies, and drove the murderers from the city. How all this was done in the teeth of and to the chagrin of the Senate was presently shown, when they blamed me for exciting the people and sent the murders away to take command of provinces, <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> to Syria and Macedonia, which were provided with great armies, telling them to hasten before the appointed time, under pretence of looking after the corn supply. And now another and still greater fear took possession of me (since I had no military force of my own as yet), lest we should be exposed without arms to the assaults of many armed men. I suspected my colleague also because he was always at variance with me, and while pretending to be in the conspiracy against <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had proposed that the day of the murder should be celebrated as the birthday of the republic.

36 1 "While I was at a loss what to do, desiring to disarm our enemies and to arm ourselves instead, I put <persName n="16">Amatius</persName> to death and recalled <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> in order to entrap the Senate again and bring it over to my side. But as even then I had no confidence in it I persuaded <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> to ask for the province of Syria, not from the Senate, but from the people by a law, and I favoured his petition so that he should become an enemy instead of a friend of the murderers, and so that the senators should be ashamed to refuse me Macedonia afterwards. Still, the Senate would not have assigned Macedonia to me, even after <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> had been provided for, by reason of the army belonging to it, if I had not previously transferred the army to <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, on the ground that Syria and the Parthian war had fallen to his lot. And again they would not have taken Macedonia and Syria away from <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> unless other provinces had been obtained for them to ensure their safety. When it became necessary to make them a recompense, look at the compensation that was given to them — Cyrene and Crete, devoid of troops, provinces which even our enemies despise as not sufficient for their safety; and they now trying to seize by force those that were taken from them. Thus in fact was the army transferred from our enemies to <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> by artifice, by stratagem, by exchange; for when there was no way to gain our end openly by arms we had necessarily to have recourse to the laws.

37 1 "After these events our enemies had raised another army and it became needful for me to have the one in Macedonia; but I was in want of a pretext. A rumour gained currency that the Getae were ravaging Macedonia. This was disbelieved, and while messengers were sent to make inquiry I brought forward the decree about the dictatorship, providing that it should not be lawful to speak of it, to vote for it, or to accept it if offered. The senators were particularly taken with this proposal and they gave me the army. Then for the first time I considered myself on an equality with my enemies, not merely with the open ones, as <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> thinks, but with the more numerous and powerful ones who still choose to remain secret. When I had accomplished these plans there remained one of the murderers on my flank, <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, governing a conveniently placed province with a large army; whom I, knowing him to be bolder than the rest, tried to deprive of Cisalpine Gaul, by promising, in order to keep up appearances with the Senate, to give him in exchange Macedonia, without an army. The Senate was indignant, for it now perceived the stratagem, and you know what kind of letters, and how many, they are writing to <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, and how they are inciting my successors in the consulship. I decided, therefore, to take a bolder course and ask the people for this province by a law, instead of asking the Senate, and I brought my army from Macedonia to Brundusium so that I might use it in emergencies. And with the help of the gods, we will use it as may be needful.

38 1 "Thus have we changed from the great fear that formerly beset us to a state of entire safety for ourselves, where we can boldly face our foes. When this change became known the multitude also let their zeals against our enemies be known. You see how the latter regret the decrees that have been passed, and what a fight they are making to deprive me of the Gallic province which has already been given to me. You know what they write to Decimus and how they are urging my successors in the consulship to get the law relating to this province changed. But with the help of our country's gods, and with pious intent, and by means of your valour, with which <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> also conquered, we will avenge him, devoting to that purpose our powers both of body and of mind.

"While these events were in progress, fellow-soldiers, I preferred that they should not be talked of; now that they are accomplished I have laid them before you, whom I shall make the sharers of my deeds and my counsels in every particular hereafter. Communicate to others, if there are any, who do not see them in the same light — excepting only <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, who behaves ungratefully towards us."13

39 1 These words of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> convinced the tribunes that in all he had done he had been moved by bitter animosity towards the murderers and that he had been scheming against the Senate. Nevertheless they urged him to come to an agreement with <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>; and, proving successful, brought about a reconciliation between them in the Capitol. But not long afterward <persName n="27">Antony</persName> announced to his friends that some of his bodyguard had been tampered with by <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, who had formed a plot against him. This he said either as a slander, or because he believed it to be true, or because he had heard of the emissaries of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> in his camp, and turned the plot to checkmate his actions into a plot against his life. When this story was noised about there was a general tumult forthwith and great indignation, for there were few who had sufficient penetration to see that it was for the interest of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> that <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, even though he was unjust to him, should live, because he (<persName n="27">Antony</persName>) was a terror to the murderers. If he were dead they would quite fearlessly dare anything, especially as they had the support of the Senate. The more intelligent knew this, but the greater part, seeing what <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> suffered daily from the indignities and the losses inflicted on him, considered the accusation not incredible, yet held it to be impious and intolerable that a conspiracy should be formed against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s life while he was consul.

<persName n="61">Augustus</persName> ran with mad fury even to those who held this opinion of him, exclaiming that it was <persName n="27">Antony</persName> who was conspiring against him to alienate him from the friendship of the people, which was the only thing left to him. He ran to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s door and repeated the same things, calling the gods to witness, taking all kinds of oaths, and inviting <persName n="27">Antony</persName> to a judicial investigation. As nobody came forward he said, "I will accept your friends as judges." With these words he attempted to enter the house. Being prevented from doing so he again cried out and railed at <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and vented his wrath against the door-keepers who prevented <persName n="27">Antony</persName> being brought to book. Then he went away and called the people to witness that if anything should happen to him his death would be due to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s plots. As these words were spoken with deep feeling the multitude underwent a change, and a kind of penitence took the place of their former opinion. There were some who still doubted, and hesitated to put faith in either of them. Some accused them both of making false pretences, believing that they had come to an agreement in the temple, and that these were plots devised against their enemies. Still others thought that this was a device of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> to increase his body-guard or to alienate the colonies of veterans from <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>.

40 1 Presently news was brought to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> by his secret emissaries that the army at Brundusium and the colonized soldiers were incensed against <persName n="27">Antony</persName> for neglecting to avenge the murder of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and that they would assist him (<persName n="61">Augustus</persName>) to do so if they could. For this reason <persName n="27">Antony</persName> departed to Brundusium. As <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> feared lest <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, returning with the army, should catch him unprotected, he went to Campania with money to enlist the veterans who had been settled in those towns by his father. He first brought over those of Calatia and next those of Casilinum, two towns situated on either side of Capua, giving 500 drachmas to each man. He collected about 10,000 men, not fully armed and not mustered in regular cohorts, but serving merely as a body-guard under one banner. The citizens of Rome were alarmed at the approach of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> with an army, and when they learned that <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was advancing with another some were doubly alarmed, while others were well pleased, believing that they could make use of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. Still others, who had seen them reconciled to each other in the Capitol, considered these transactions a game of false pretences by which <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was to have the supreme power and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> in return was to wreak vengeance on the murderers.

41 1 In this time of consternation <persName n="98">Cannutius</persName>, the tribune, an enemy of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and hence friendly to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, went to meet the latter. Having learned his intentions <persName n="98">Cannutius</persName> addressed the people, saying that <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was advancing with real hostility to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and that those who were afraid that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was aiming at tyranny should side with <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> as they had no other army at present. After speaking thus he brought in <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, who was encamped before the city at the temple of Mars, fifteen stades distant. When the latter arrived he proceeded to the temple of Castor and Pollux, which his soldiers surrounded carrying concealed daggers. <persName n="98">Cannutius</persName> addressed the people first, speaking against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. Afterwards <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> also reminded them of his father and of what he had himself suffered at the hands of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, on account of which he had enlisted this army as a guard for himself. He declared himself the obedient servant of his country in all things, and said that he was ready to confront <persName n="27">Antony</persName> in the present emergency.

42 1 After he had thus spoken and dismissed the assembly, the soldiers, taking the opposite view (that they had come to support the alliance of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> or as a mere guard for the latter and to punish the murderers), were vexed at the declaration of war against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who had been their general and was now consul. Some of them asked leave to return home in order to arm themselves, saying that they could not perform their duty with other arms than their own. Others hinted at the truth. As things had turned out contrary to his expectation, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was at a loss what to do. Hoping, however, to retain them by persuasion rather than by force he yielded to their requests, and sent some of them to get their arms and others simply to their homes. Concealing his disappointment he praised all the assembled multitude, gave them fresh presents, and said that he would reward them still more generously, for he made use of them for emergencies rather as the friends of his father than as soldiers. After he had spoken these words, he influenced 1000 only from 10,000 to remain with him, or perhaps 3000, for accounts differ as to the number. The rest then took their departure, but presently they remembered the toils of agriculture and the gains of military service, the words of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, his compliance with their wishes, and the favours they had received and hoped still to receive from him. And so, as a fickle multitude would, they repented, and seizing upon their former pretext for the sake of appearances, they armed themselves and went back to him. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had already proceeded with new supplies of money to Ravenna and the neighbouring parts, continually enlisting new forces and sending them all to Arretium.

43 1 In the meantime four of the five Macedonian legions had joined <persName n="27">Antony</persName> at Brundusium. They blamed him because he had not proceeded against the murderers of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. They conducted him without applause to the platform, implying that they required explanations on this subject first. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was angry at their silence. He did not keep his temper, but charged them with ingratitude in that they had expressed no thanks for being transferred from the Parthian expedition to Italy. He blamed them because they had not arrested and delivered to him the emissaries of a rash boy (for so he called <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>) who had been sent among them to stir up discord. Those men he would find out himself, he said; but the army he would lead to the province voted to him, the prosperous Gallic country, and would give 100 drachmas to each man present. They laughed at his parsimony, and when he became angry they broke out in tumult and went away. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> rose and departed, saying, "You shall learn to obey orders." Then he required the military tribunes to bring before him the seditious characters (for it is customary in Roman armies to keep at all times a record of the character of each man). From these he chose by lot a certain number according to military law, and he put to death not every tenth man, but a smaller number, thinking that he would thus quickly strike terror into them. But the others were turned to rage and hatred instead of fear by this act.

44 1 In view of these facts the men whom <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had sent to tamper with the soldiers distributed the greatest possible number of handbills throughout the camp, reflecting on <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s stinginess and cruelty, recalling the memory of the elder <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and urging them to share the service of the younger and his liberal gifts. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> tried to find these emissaries by means of rewards to informers and threats against those who abetted them, but as he caught no one he became angry, believing that the soldiers concealed them. When the news came of what <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was doing among the colonized veterans and at Rome, he became alarmed, and going before the army again he said that he was sorry for what he had been compelled by military discipline to do to a few instead of the much larger number who were punishable by law, and that they must know very well that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was neither cruel nor stingy. "Let us lay aside ill-will," he continued, "and rest satisfied with these faults and punishments. The 100 drachmas which I have ordered to be given you is not my donative, for that would be unworthy of the fortune of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, but a small dole to mark our first meeting rather than a full reward; but it is necessary to obey the laws of our country, and of the army, in this affair as in all others." When he had thus spoken he did not as yet add anything to the donative, that it might not seem that as general he had yielded anything to the army; but they, whether moved by penitence or by fear, took what was given them. <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, however, being still angry at the outbreak, or from some other suspicion, changed their tribunes, but the rest of the army he treated well because he had need of their services, and he sent them forward by detachments along the sea-coast toward Ariminum.

45 1 <persName n="27">Antony</persName> chose from the whole number a praetorian cohort of the men who were best in body and character and marched to Rome, intending to push on thence toward Ariminum. He entered the city in a haughty manner, leaving his squadron of horse encamped outside the walls. But the troops that accompanied him were girded as for war, and they mounted guard over his house by night under arms, and he gave them a countersign and relieved them regularly, just as in a camp. He convoked the Senate in order to make complaint of the acts of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and just as he was entering it he learned that the so‑called Martian legion, one of the four on the road, had gone over to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. While he was waiting at the entrance cogitating over this news it was announced to him that another legion, called the Fourth, had followed the example of the Martian and espoused the side of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. Disconcerted as he was he entered the senate-house, pretending that he had convened them about other matters, said a few words, and immediately departed to the city gates, and thence to the town of Alba, in order to persuade the deserters to come back to him. They shot arrows at him from the walls, and he retreated. To the other legions he forwarded 500 drachmas per man. With the soldiers he had with him he marched to Tibur, taking the equipment customary to those who are going to war; for war was now certain, since <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> had refused to give up Cisalpine Gaul.

46 1 While <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was at Tibur nearly all the Senate, and the greater part of the knights, and the most influential plebeians, came there to do him honour. These persons, arriving while he was swearing into his service the soldiers present and also the discharged veterans who had flocked in (of whom there was a goodly number), voluntarily joined in taking the oath that they would not fail in friendship and fidelity to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>; so that one would have been at a loss to know who were the men who, a little while before, had decried <persName n="27">Antony</persName> at <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s public meeting.

With this brilliant send-off <persName n="27">Antony</persName> started for Ariminum, which lies on the border of Cisalpine Gaul. His army, exclusive of the new levies, consisted of three legions summoned from Macedonia (for the remainder had now arrived). There was also one of discharged veterans, old men, who appeared nevertheless to be worth twice as much as the new levies. Thus <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had four legions of well-disciplined troops, and the helpers who usually accompanied them, besides his body-guard and the new levies. <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> in Spain now four legions, <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> with two, and <persName n="378">Plancus</persName> in Transalpine Gaul with three, seemed likely to espouse the side of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>.

47 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had two legions equally efficient, those which had deserted from <persName n="27">Antony</persName> to him, also one legion of new levies, and two of veterans, not complete in numbers or in arms, but these also filled up with new recruits. He brought them all to Alba and there communicated with the Senate, which congratulated him in such a way that now one would have been at a loss to know who were those who had lately ranged themselves with <persName n="27">Antony</persName>; but it regretted that the legions had not come over to the Senate itself instead of to him. It praised them and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> nevertheless, and said that it would vote them whatever was needful as soon as the new magistrates should enter upon their duties. It was plain that the Senate would use these forces against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>; but having no army of its own anywhere, and being unable to levy one without consuls, it adjourned all business until the new consuls should come in.14

48 1 The soldiers of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> furnished him lictors provided with fasces and urged him to assume the title of propraetor, carrying on war and acting as their leader, since they were always marshalled under magistrates. He thanked them for the honour, but referred the matter to the Senate. When they wanted to go before the Senate en masse he prevented them and would not even allow them to send messengers, believing that the Senate would vote these things to him voluntarily; "and all the more," he said, "if they know of your zeal and my hesitation."

They were reconciled to this course with difficulty. The leading officers complained that he disdained them, and he explained to them that the Senate was moved not so much by good-will toward him as by fear of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and the want of an army; "and that will be the case," he continued, "until we humble <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and until the murderers, who are friends and relatives of the senators, collect a military force for them. Knowing these facts I falsely pretend to be serving them. Let us not be the first to expose this false pretence. If we usurp the office they will accuse us of arrogance and violence, whereas if we are modest they will probably give it of their own accord, fearing lest I accept it from you." After he had thus spoken he witnessed some military exercises of the two legions that had deserted from <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who ranged themselves opposite each other and gave a complete representation of a battle, except only the killing. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was delighted with the spectacle and was pleased to make this a pretext for distributing 500 drachmas more to each man, and he promised that in case of war he would give them 5000 drachmas each if they were victorious. Thus, by means of lavish gifts, did <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> bind these mercenaries to himself.

49 1 Such was the course of events in Italy. In Cisalpine Gaul <persName n="27">Antony</persName> ordered <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> to withdraw to Macedonia in obedience to the decree of the Roman people, and for his own safety. <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, in reply, sent him the letters that had been furnished him by the Senate, as much as to say that he cared no more for the command of the people than <persName n="27">Antony</persName> did for that of the Senate. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> then fixed a day for his compliance, after which he should treat him as an enemy. <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> advised him to fix a later day lest <persName n="27">Antony</persName> should too soon make himself an enemy to the Senate. Although <persName n="27">Antony</persName> could have easily overcome him, as he was still in the open country, he decided to proceed first against the cities. These opened their gates to him. <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, fearing that he for his part should now be unable to enter any of them, fabricated letters from the Senate calling him to Rome with his army and retired towards Italy, admitted by all as they thought he was departing, until he arrived at the wealthy city of Mutina.15 Here he closed the gates and possessed himself of the property of the inhabitants for the support of his army. He slaughtered and salted all the cattle he could find there in anticipation of a long siege, and awaited <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. His army consisted of a large number of gladiators and three legions of infantry, one of which was composed of new recruits as yet inexperienced. The other two had served under him and were entirely trustworthy. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> advanced against him with fury, and drew a line of circum­vallation around Mutina.

50 1 <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, then, was besieged: but at Rome, at the beginning of the new year, the consuls, <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName> and <persName n="396">Pansa</persName>, convened the Senate on the subject of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> immediately after the sacrifices had been performed and in the very temple. <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> and his friends urged that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> be now declared a public enemy, since he had seized Cisalpine Gaul with an armed force against the will of the Senate and made of it a point of attack on the republic, and had brought into Italy an army given to him to operate against the Thracians. They spoke also of his seeking the supreme power as <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s successor, because he publicly surrounded himself more haughtily in other respects than was befitting a yearly magistrate. <persName n="283">Lucius Calpurnius Piso</persName>, who had charge of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s interest in his absence, a man among the most illustrious in Rome, and others who sided with him on his own account, or on <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s, or because of their own opinion, contended that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> ought to have a trial, that it was not the custom of their ancestors to condemn a man unheard, that it was not decent to declare a man an enemy to‑day who was a consul yesterday, and especially one whom <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> himself as well as the rest had so often lavishly praised. The Senate, which was about equally divided in opinion, remained in session until night. Early the next morning it reassembled to consider the same question and then the party of <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> was in the majority and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> would have been voted a public enemy had not the tribune <persName n="502">Salvius</persName> adjourned the sitting to the following day; for among the magistrates the one who has the veto always prevails.

51 1 The <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>nians heaped gross reproaches and insults on <persName n="502">Salvius</persName> for this, and hastening out tried to excite the people against him and summoned him to answer before them. He set forth to obey the summons undismayed until he was restrained by the Senate, which feared lest he should cause the people to change by recalling <persName n="27">Antony</persName> to their memory; for the senators well knew that they were condemning an illustrious man without a trial, and that the people had given him this very Gallic province. But since they feared for the safety of the murderers they were angry with <persName n="27">Antony</persName> because he had made the first movement against them after the amnesty, for which reason the Senate had previously called in the help of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> against him. Although <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> knew this he desired nevertheless to take the lead in humbling <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. Such were the reasons why the Senate was angry with <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. Although the vote on him was adjourned by the command of the tribune, they passed a decree praising <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> for not abandoning Cisalpine Gaul to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and directing <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> to assist the consuls, <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName> and <persName n="396">Pansa</persName>, with the army he now had. They awarded him a gilded statue and the right to declare his opinion among the consulars in the Senate even now, and the right to stand for the consulship itself ten years before the legal period, and voted from the public treasury to the legions that deserted from <persName n="27">Antony</persName> to him the same amount that he promised to give them if they should be victorious.

After passing these decrees they adjourned, that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> might in fact know from the votes taken that he was declared a public enemy and that on the following day the tribune would no longer interpose his veto. The mother, the wife, and the son of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> (who was still a young man), and his other relatives and friends went around the whole night visiting the houses of influential men and beseeching them. In the morning they put themselves in the way of those going to the senate-house, fell at their feet with wailing and lamentation and in mourning garments, crying out alongside the doors. Some of the senators were moved by these cries, this spectacle, this so sudden change of fortune. <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, fearing the result, addressed the Senate as follows:—

52 1 "What decision ought to be reached concerning <persName n="27">Antony</persName> we determined yesterday. When we bestowed honours on his enemies we thereby voted him an enemy. <persName n="502">Salvius</persName>, who alone interrupted the proceedings, must either have been wiser than all the rest, or moved to do by private friendship, or by ignorance of present circumstances. It would be most disgraceful of us, on the one hand, if all should seem to know less than one, and to <persName n="502">Salvius</persName>, on the other hand, if he should prefer private friendship to the public weal. If he is not well acquainted with the present circumstances he ought to repose confidence in the consuls, rather than himself, in the praetors, in his fellow-tribunes, and the other senators, so imposing in dignity and in numbers, so much his superiors in age and experience, who condemn <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. In our elections and in our jury trials justice is ever on the side of the majority. If it be needful still to acquaint him with the reasons for our action I will briefly recount the principal ones by way of reminder.

"At <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s death <persName n="27">Antony</persName> possessed himself of our money. Having been invested with the government of Macedonia by us he seized upon that of Cisalpine Gaul without our authority. Having received an army to operate against the Thracians he brought it into Italy instead. Each of these powers he asked from us for his own secret motives, and when they were refused he acted on his own authority. At Brundusium he organized a royal cohort for his own use and openly made men-at‑arms his private guards and night-watchmen, serving under a countersign. The whole remainder of the army he led from Brundusium to the city, aiming by a shorter path at the same designs that <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> contemplated. Being anticipated by the younger <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and his army he became alarmed and turned his course to the Gallic province as a convenient point of attack on us, because <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had used it as his base when he made himself our master.

53 1 "In order to intimidate the soldiers to do every unlawful act he should order, he decimated them although they had not revolted and had not abandoned their watch or their ranks in time of war, for which offences alone military law allows such cruel punishment, which only a few generals have visited upon their soldiers and with reluctance, in cases of extreme peril, as a matter of necessity. These citizens <persName n="27">Antony</persName> put to death for a word or a laugh; a death, moreover, of men not regularly condemned but merely chosen by lot. For this reason those who could do so revolted from him, and you yesterday voted them a donative as well-doers. Those who could not desert joined him in wrongdoing under the influence of fear, marched against our province as enemies, and besieged our army and our general, to whom you send letters directing him to hold the province, while <persName n="27">Antony</persName> now orders him to evacuate it. Are we voting <persName n="27">Antony</persName> an enemy, or is he already making war against us? And these things our tribune is still ignorant of, and will remain so until <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> is overthrown and this great province on our border, together with the army of <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, is added to the resources with which <persName n="27">Antony</persName> hopes to attack us. I suppose that the tribune will vote <persName n="27">Antony</persName> an enemy only as soon as he becomes our master."16

54 1 While <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> was yet speaking his friends broke forth in such tumultuous applause that for a long time nobody could be heard on the other side, until finally <persName n="283">Lucius Calpurnius Piso</persName> came forward, when the senators, out of respect for him, became silent and even the <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>nians restrained themselves. Then Piso said: "Our law, Senators, requires that the accused shall himself hear the charge preferred against him and shall be judged after he has made his own defence; and for the truth of this I appeal to <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, our greatest orator. Since, however, he hesitates to accuse <persName n="27">Antony</persName> when present, but brings against him in his absence certain charges which he considers of the greatest gravity, and not open to doubt, I have come forward to show, in the fewest words, that these charges are false. He says that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> converted the public money to his own use after <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s death. The law declares such a person to be a thief, not a public enemy, and limits his punishment accordingly. After <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> had killed <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> he accused the latter before the people of plundering the public money and leaving the treasury empty. Soon afterward <persName n="27">Antony</persName> proposed a decree to investigate these matters and you adopted and confirmed his motion and promised a reward of one-tenth to informers, which reward we will double if anybody will prove that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had any part in the fraud.

55 1 "So much for the charge in reference to money. We did not vote the governorship of Cisalpine Gaul to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, but the people gave it to him by a law, <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> being present; just as other provinces had often been given, and as this same governorship had previously been given to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. It was a part of this law that, when <persName n="27">Antony</persName> should arrive at the province given to him, if <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> would not yield it <persName n="27">Antony</persName> should declare war and lead the army into the Gallic province against him, instead of using it against the Thracians, who were still quiet. But <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> does not consider <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, who is entrenching himself against the law, an enemy, although he considers <persName n="27">Antony</persName> an enemy who is fighting on the side of the law. He who accuses the law itself accuses the authors of the law, whom he ought to change by persuasion, not to insult after having himself agreed with them. He ought not to entrust the province to <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, whom the people drove out of the city on account of the murder, while refusing to entrust to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> what the people gave to him. It is not the part of good counsellors to be at variance with the people, especially in times of danger, or to forget that this very power of deciding who are friends and who are enemies formerly belonged to the people. According to the ancient laws the people are the sole arbiters of peace and war. Heaven grant that they may not be reminded of this, and consequently be angry with us when they have found a leader.

56 1 "But it is said that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> put certain soldiers to death. Being commander-in‑chief he was empowered to do so by you. No commander has ever yet rendered an account of such matters. The laws do not consider it expedient that the general should be answerable to his soldiers. There is nothing worse in an army than disobedience, on account of which some soldiers have been put to death even after a victory, and no one called to account those who killed them. None of their relatives complain now, but <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> complains and while accusing <persName n="27">Antony</persName> of murder stigmatizes him as a public enemy, instead of calling for the punishment prescribed for murderers. The desertion of two of his legions shows how insubordinate and arrogant <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s army was — legions which you have voted that he should command, and who deserted, in violation of military law, not to you, but to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. Nevertheless <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> praised them and yesterday proposed that they be paid out of the public treasury. Heaven grant that this example may not plague you hereafter. Hatred has betrayed <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> into inconsistency, for he accused <persName n="27">Antony</persName> of aiming at supreme power and yet punishing his soldiers, whereas such conspirators are always lenient, not severe, toward the men serving under them. As <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> does not hesitate to arraign as tyrannical all the rest of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s administration since <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s death, come, let me examine his acts one by one.

57 1 "Whom has <persName n="27">Antony</persName> put to death in a tyrannical manner without trial — he who is now in danger of being condemned himself without trial? Whom has he banished from the city? Whom has he slandered in our presence? Or, if innocent toward us individually, has he conspired against all of us collectively? When, <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>? Was it when he carried through the Senate the act of amnesty for the past? Was it when he abstained from prosecuting anybody for the murder? Was it when he moved an investigation of the public accounts? Was it when he proposed the recall of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> the son of your <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, and payment for his father's confiscated property out of the public treasury? Was it when he seized that conspirator, <persName n="16">Amatius</persName>, and put him to death, and you all applauded, and because you did so it was the only act of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> that <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> did not calumniate? Was it when he brought in a decree that nobody should ever propose a dictatorship, or vote for it, and that anybody disobeying the decree might be killed with impunity by anyone who wished? These are the public acts that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> performed for us during two months, the only months that he remained in the city after <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s death, the very time when the people were pursuing the murders and you were apprehensive of the future. If he were a villain what better opportunity could he have had?

"But, you will say, the fact is quite the other way: he was not in authority. What? Did he not exercise the sole authority after <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> departed for Syria? Did he not keep an armed force that you gave him in readiness in the city? Did he not patrol the city by night? Was he not guarded at night against any conspiracy of his enemies? Did he not have an excuse for this in the murder of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, his friend and benefactor, the man most beloved by the common people? Did he not have another of a personal kind in the fact that the murderers conspired against his life also? Yet none of them did he kill or banish, but pardoned them what he could in decency, and did not begrudge them the governorships that were offered to them.
"You behold then, Romans, these very grave and indisputable charges of <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. 58 1 But since in addition to charges, surmises are introduced to the effect that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was about to lead an army to the city, but became alarmed because <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had anticipated him with another army, how does it happen that, when the mere intention to do this makes a man an enemy, the one who actually comes and encamps alongside of us without emblems of authority is not regarded by <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> as an enemy? What would have prevented <persName n="27">Antony</persName> from coming if he had wanted to? With 30,000 men in line was he afraid of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s 3000, half-armed, unorganized, who had come together merely to gain his friendship, and who left him as soon as they knew that he had chosen them for war? If <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was afraid to come with 30,000 how did he dare to come with only 1000? With these what a crowd of us accompanied him to Tibur! What a crowd of us voluntarily joined the soldiers in taking the oath of fidelity to him! What praises did <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> lavish on his acts and virtues! If <persName n="27">Antony</persName> himself contemplated any such thing as invasion why did he leave as pledges in our hands his mother, his wife, and his grown up son, who are even now at the door of the Senate-house weeping and fearful, not on account of the policy of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, but of the overwhelming power of his enemies.

59 1 "These facts I have now brought before you as proof of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s defiance and of <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>'s fickleness. I will add an exhortation to right-minded men, not to do injustice to the people or to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, not to expose the public interests to new enmities and dangers while the commonwealth is sick and in want of timely defenders, but to establish a sufficient force in the city before breeding disorder outside, to provide against attacks from every quarter, and to come to such decisions as you please when you are able to carry them into effect. How shall these ends be accomplished? By allowing <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, as a matter of policy, or for the sake of the people, to have Cisalpine Gaul. Call <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> thence with his three legions, and when he comes send him to Macedonia, retaining his legions there. If the two legions that deserted from <persName n="27">Antony</persName> deserted to us, as <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> says, let us summon them also from <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> to the city. Thus with five legions sustaining us we might pass such decrees as we think best with entire confidence, depending on the favour of no man.

60 1 "I have addressed these words to men who listen to me without malice or the spirit of contention. Those who would excite you heedlessly and inconsiderately on account of private enmity and private strife I exhort not to come to hasty and rash decisions against the most important personages, who command strong armies, and not to force them into war against their will. Remember <persName n="331">Marcius Coriolanus</persName>. Recall the recent doings of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, whom we rashly voted an enemy while he was in like manner leading an army and offering us the fairest terms of peace, whereby we forced him to be an enemy in deed. Have regard for the people who were lately pursuing <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s murderers, lest we seem to insult them by giving those murderers the governorship of provinces, by praising <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> for nullifying the people's law, and by voting <persName n="27">Antony</persName> an enemy because he accepted the Gallic province from the people. For which reasons the well-wishers of the country ought to take thought for the erring, and the consuls and tribunes ought to multiply their activities17 in view of the public dangers."

61 1 Thus did <persName n="283">Lucius Calpurnius Piso</persName> defend <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, reproaching his enemies and alarming them. He was evidently the cause of their not voting <persName n="27">Antony</persName> an enemy. Nevertheless, he did not succeed in securing for him the governorship of the Gallic province. The friends and relatives of the murderers prevented it, fearing lest, at the end of the war, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> should join <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> in avenging the murder, for which reason they meant to keep <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> always at variance with each other. They voted to offer <persName n="27">Antony</persName> Macedonia instead of the Gallic province, and they ordered, either heedlessly or designedly, that the other commands of the Senate be reduced to writing by <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> and delivered to the ambassadors. <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> altered the decree and wrote as follows: "<persName n="27">Antony</persName> must raise the siege of Mutina forthwith, relinquish Cisalpine Gaul to community, withdraw to the hither side of the river Rubicon (which forms the boundary between Italy and the province) before a specified day, and submit himself in all things to the Senate." Thus provokingly and falsely did <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> write the orders of the Senate, not by reason of an underlying hostility, as it seems, but at the instigation of some evil spirit that was goading the republic to revolution and meditating destruction to <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> himself.18 The remains of <persName n="579">Trebonius</persName> having been lately brought home and the indignities visited upon him more carefully inquired into, the Senate with little opposition declared <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> a public enemy.

62 1 The ambassadors who had been sent to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, ashamed of the extraordinary character of the orders, said nothing, but simply delivered them to him. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> in his wrath indulged in many invectives against the Senate and <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>. "He was astonished," he said, "that they should consider <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> (the man who had contributed most to the Roman sway) a tyrant and a king, and did not so consider <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, whom <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had captured in war and whose life he had spared, while <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> in return now prefers <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s assassins to his friends. He hated <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> as long as the latter was the friend of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, but loves him now that he has become his murderer. He favours a man who took the province of Gaul after <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s death without authority, and makes war on one who received it at the hands of the people. He gives rewards to those who deserted from the legions voted to me, and none to those who remain faithful, thus impairing military discipline not more to my disadvantage than to that of the state. He has given amnesty to the murderers, to which I have assented on account of two men who deserve respect. He holds <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> and myself as enemies because we keep what was given us. That is the real reason. And if I but withdraw from Gaul, then I am neither enemy nor autocrat! I declare that I will bring to naught the amnesty with which they are not satisfied."

63 1 After saying much more to the same purpose <persName n="27">Antony</persName> wrote his reply to the decree, saying that he would obey the Senate in all respects as the voice of his country, but to <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, who wrote the orders, he made the following answer: "The people gave me the province of Gaul by a law, and I shall prosecute <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> for not obeying the law, and I shall visit with punishment for the murder him alone, as representative of them all, in order that the Senate, which now participates in the wickedness by reason of <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>'s support of <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, may at last be purged of such pollution." These words <persName n="27">Antony</persName> spoke and wrote in reply.19 The Senate immediately voted him an enemy and also the army under him, if it should not abandon him. The government of Macedonia and Illyria, with the troops still remaining in both, was assigned to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> until the republic should be re-established. The latter already had an army of his own and had received some troops from <persName n="548">Apuleius</persName>. He also had war-ships and ships of burden and about 16,000 talents in money, and quantities of arms which he found in Demetrias, where they had been placed by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> long before, all of which the Senate now voted that he should use for the advantage of the republic. They voted that <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> should be governor of Syria and that he should make war against <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, and that all other commanders of Roman provinces and soldiers between the Adriatic sea and the Orient should obey the orders of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> in all things.

64 1 Thus quickly did the Senate seize the opportunity to put the affairs of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and his party in a brilliant aspect. When <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> learned what had been done he was troubled. He had considered the amnesty in the light of an act of humanity and of pity for the relatives and compeers of these men, and that the very small commands had been given them for their safety merely; finally, the confirming of the Gallic province to <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> seemed to him to have been done by reason of the Senate's difference with <persName n="27">Antony</persName> respecting the supreme power, on which ground also they were inciting him against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. But the voting of <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> an enemy because he had put one of the murderers to death, the changing of the commands of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> to the largest provinces, the granting of great armies and large sums of money to them and putting them in command of all the governors beyond the Adriatic sea — all pointed plainly to the building up of the party of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and the pulling down of that of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. He bethought himself of their artifice in treating him as a young man, in providing him a statue and a front seat, and giving him the title of propraetor, when in fact they were taking from him what army he did have, for a propraetor has absolutely no authority when consuls are serving with him. Then the rewards voted only to those of his soldiers who had deserted from <persName n="27">Antony</persName> to him were an indignity to those who had enlisted under him. Finally the war would be nothing but a disgrace to him, for the Senate would simply make use of him against <persName n="27">Antony</persName> till the latter was crushed.

65 1 Meditating thus to himself he performed the sacrifices appertaining to the command assigned to him, and said to his army: "I owe these honours of mine to you, fellow-soldiers, not now merely but from the time when you gave me the command; for the Senate conferred them upon me on account of you. Know, therefore, that my gratitude will be due to you for these things, and that it will be expressed to you abundantly if the gods grant success to our undertakings."

In this way he conciliated the soldiers and attached them to himself. In the meantime, <persName n="396">Pansa</persName>, one of the consuls, was collecting recruits throughout Italy, and the other one, <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName>, shared the command of the forces with <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and as he was secretly ordered to do it by the Senate he demanded as his share the two legions that had deserted from <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, knowing that they were the most reliable in the army. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> yielded to him in everything and they shared with each other and went into winter quarters together. As winter advanced <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> began to suffer from hunger, and <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> advanced towards Mutina lest <persName n="27">Antony</persName> should receive in surrender <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>' army which was now weak with famine; but as Mutina was closely hemmed in by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, they did not venture to come to close quarters with him at once, but waited for <persName n="396">Pansa</persName>. There were frequent cavalry engagements, as <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had a much larger force of horse, but the difficulty of the ground, which was cut up by torrents, deprived him of the advantage of numbers.

66 1 Such was the course of events round Mutina. At Rome, in the absence of the consuls, <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> took the lead by public speaking. He held frequent assemblies, procured arms by inducing the armourers to work without pay, collected money, and exacted heavy contributions from the Antonians. These paid without complaining in order to avoid calumny, until <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName>, who had served under <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and who was a friend of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, unable to endure the exactions of <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, betook himself to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s colonies, where he was well known, and brought over two legions to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and hastened to Rome to seize <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>. The consternation was extreme. They removed most of the women and children in a panic, and <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> himself fled from the city. When <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName> learned this he turned his course towards <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, but being intercepted by <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName>, he proceeded to Picenum, where he recruited another legion and waited to see what would happen.20

When <persName n="396">Pansa</persName> was drawing near with his army, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName> sent <persName n="102">Carsuleius</persName> to him with <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s praetorian cohort and the Martian legion to assist him in passing through the defile. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had disdained to occupy the defile as it served no other purpose than to hinder the enemy; but, eager to fight, and having no chance to win distinction with his cavalry, because the ground was marshy and cut by ditches, he placed his two best legions in ambush in the marsh, where they were concealed by the reeds and where the road, which had been thrown up artificially, was narrow.

67 1 <persName n="102">Carsuleius</persName> and <persName n="396">Pansa</persName> hurried through the defile by night. At daybreak, with only the Martian legion and five other cohorts, they entered upon the high road above mentioned, which was still free from enemies, and looked over the marsh on either side. There was a suspicious agitation of the rushes, then a gleam here and there of shield and helmet, and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s praetorian cohort suddenly shewed itself directly in their front. The Martian legion, surrounded on all sides and having no way to escape, ordered the new levies, if they came up, not to join in the fight lest they should cause confusion by their inexperience. The praetorians of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> confronted the praetorians of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. The other troops divided themselves into two parts and advanced into the marsh on either side, the one commanded by <persName n="396">Pansa</persName> and the other by <persName n="102">Carsuleius</persName>. Thus there were two battles in two marshes, and neither division could see the other by reason of the elevated road, while along the road itself the praetorian cohorts fought another battle of their own. The Antonians were determined to punish the Martians for desertion as being traitors to themselves. The Martians were equally determined to punish the Antonians for condoning the slaughter of their comrades at Brundusium. Recognizing in each other the flower of either army, they hoped to decide the whole war by this single engagement. The one side was moved by shame lest its two legions be beaten by one; the other by ambition that its single legion should overcome the two.

68 1 Thus urged on by animosity and ambition they assailed each other, considering this their own affair rather than that of their generals. Being veterans they raised no battle-cry, since they could not expect to terrify each other, nor in the engagement did they utter a sound, either as victors or vanquished. As there could be neither flanking nor charging amid marshes and ditches, they met together in close order, and since neither could dislodge the other they locked together with their swords as in a wrestling match. No blow missed its mark. There were wounds and slaughter but no cries, only groans; and when one fell he was instantly borne away and another took his place. They needed neither admonition nor encouragement, since experience made each one his own general. When they were overcome by fatigue they drew apart from each other for a brief space to take breath, as in gymnastic games, and then rushed again to the encounter. Amazement took possession of the new levies who had come up, as they beheld such deeds done with such precision and in such silence.

69 1 All put forth superhuman exertions, and the praetorians of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> perished to the last man. Those of the Martians who were under <persName n="102">Carsuleius</persName> got the better of those opposed to them, who gave way, not in disgraceful rout, but little by little. Those under <persName n="396">Pansa</persName> were likewise in difficulties, but they held out with equal bravery on both sides until <persName n="396">Pansa</persName> was wounded in the side by a javelin and carried off the field to Bononia. Then his soldiers retired, at first step by step, but afterwards they turned and hurried as if in flight. When the new levies saw this they fled in disorder, and with loud cries, to their camp, which the quaestor, <persName n="576">Torquatus</persName>, had put in readiness for them while the battle was in progress, apprehending that it might be needed. The new levies crowded into it confusedly although they were Italians, as well as the Martians; so much more does training contribute to bravery than race; but the Martians for fear of shame did not enter into the camp, but ranged themselves near it. Although fatigued they were still furious and ready to fight to the bitter end if anybody should attack them. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> refrained from attacking the Martians as being a troublesome business, but he fell upon the new levies and made a great slaughter.

70 1 When <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName>, near Mutina, heard of this flight, at a distance of sixty stades, he hurried thither with the other legion that had deserted from <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. It was already evening and the victorious Antonians were returning singing hymns of triumph. While they were in loose order <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName> made his appearance in perfect order with his legion complete and fresh. The Antonians got themselves in line under compulsion, and performed against this foe also many splendid deeds of valour; but being wearied by their recent exertions they were overcome by the fresh army opposed to them, and the greater part of them were slain in this encounter by <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName>, although the latter did not pursue, being apprehensive of the marshy ground. As darkness was coming on he allowed them to escape. A wide stretch of the marsh was filled with arms, corpses, wounded men, and half-dead men, and some even who were unhurt mistrusted their strength by reason of their fatigue. <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s cavalry, as many as he had with him, went to their assistance and collected them through the entire night. Some they put on horseback in their own places, still others they urged to take hold of the horses' tails and run along with them and so secure their safety. Thus were <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s forces, after he had fought splendidly, destroyed by the coming of <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName>. He encamped without entrenchments in a village near the plain, named Forum Gallorum. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="396">Pansa</persName> each lost about one-half of their men. The whole of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s praetorian cohort perished. The loss of <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName> was slight.

71 1 The next day they all withdrew to the camps at Mutina. After so severe a disaster <persName n="27">Antony</persName> decided not to come to a general engagement with his enemies at present, not even if they should attack him, but merely to harass them daily with his cavalry until <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, who was reduced to extremity by famine, should surrender. For this very reason <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> decided to push on a fight. As <persName n="27">Antony</persName> would not come out when they offered battle, they moved toward the other side of Mutina where it was less closely besieged on account of the badness of the ground, as if about to force their way into the town with their strong army. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> hung upon their movement with his cavalry and this time also with those alone. But as the enemy, too, fought him with their cavalry only, the rest of their army moving to effect their purposes, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, lest he should lose Mutina, drew out of his entrenchments two legions. Then his enemies, rejoicing at this, turned and delivered battle. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> ordered up other legions from other camps, but as they came slowly, by reason of the suddenness of the call or the long distance, the army of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> won the victory. <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName> even broke into <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s camp, where he was killed, fighting near the general's tent. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> rushed in and carried off his body and possessed himself of the camp. A little later he was driven out by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. Both sides passed the night also under arms.

72 1 When <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had suffered this second defeat, he took counsel with his friends directly after the battle. They advised him to adhere to his first resolution, to continue the siege of Mutina and not to go out and fight, saying that the losses had been about equal on both sides, <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName> having been killed and <persName n="396">Pansa</persName> wounded; they said that he was superior in cavalry and that Mutina was reduced to extremity by famine and must succumb. Such was the advice of his friends, and it was truly for the best. But <persName n="27">Antony</persName> already under some divine infatuation, was fearful lest <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> should make another attempt to break into Mutina like that of yesterday, or even try to enclose him, as <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had the greater force to work with, "in which case," said he, "our cavalry will be useless and <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> and <persName n="378">Plancus</persName> will despise me as a vanquished man. If we withdraw from Mutina, <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName> will presently join us with three legions from Picenum, and <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> and <persName n="378">Plancus</persName> will be emboldened to ally themselves with him." So he spake, although he was not a timid man in the presence of danger; and breaking camp forthwith he made his way toward the Alps.

73 1 When <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> was delivered from the siege he began to be afraid of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, whom, after the removal of the two consuls, he feared as an enemy. So he broke down the bridge over the river before daybreak and sent certain persons to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> in a boat, as if to return thanks for rescuing him, and asked that <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> would come to the opposite bank of the river to hold a conversation with him in the presence of the citizens as witnesses, because he could convince <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, he said, that an evil spirit had deceived him and that he had been led into the conspiracy against <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> by others. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> answered the messengers in a tone of anger, declining the thanks that <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> gave him, saying: "I am here not to rescue <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, but to fight <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, with whom I may properly come to terms some time, but nature forbids that I should even look at <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> or hold any conversation with him. Let him have safety, however, as long as the authorities at Rome please." When <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> heard this he stood on the river bank and, calling <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> by name, read with a loud voice the letters of the Senate giving him command of the Gallic province, and forbade <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> to cross the river without consular authority into the government belonging to another, and not to follow <persName n="27">Antony</persName> further, for that he himself would be quite capable of pursuing him. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> knew that he was prompted to this audacious course by the Senate, and although able to seize him by giving an order, he spared him for the present and withdrew to <persName n="396">Pansa</persName> at Bononia, where he wrote a full report to the Senate, and <persName n="396">Pansa</persName> did likewise.

74 1 In Rome <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> read to the people the report of the consul, and to the Senate alone that of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. For the victory over <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, he caused them to vote a thanksgiving of fifty days, — a longer festivity than the Romans had ever decreed even after the Gallic or any other war. He induced them to give the army of the consuls to <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, although <persName n="396">Pansa</persName> was still alive (for his life was now despaired of), and to appoint <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> the sole commander against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. Public prayers were offered that <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> might prevail over him. Such was <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>'s passion and want of decorum in reference to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. He confirmed again, to the two legions that had deserted from <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, the 5000 drachmas per man previously promised to them as the rewards of victory, as though they had already conquered, and gave them the perpetual right to wear the olive crown at the public festivals. There was nothing about <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> in the decrees, and his name was not even mentioned. He was forthwith disregarded as though <persName n="27">Antony</persName> were already destroyed. They wrote to <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, to <persName n="378">Plancus</persName>, and to <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> to continue the campaign so as to come to close quarters with <persName n="27">Antony</persName>.

75 1 Such was the course of events at Rome. In the meantime <persName n="396">Pansa</persName> was dying of his wound, and he summoned <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> to his side, and said:21 "I loved your father as I did myself, yet I could not avenge his death, nor could I fail to unite with the majority, whom you have also done well to obey, although you have an army. At first they feared you and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and especially <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, as he also seemed to be the most ambitious to continue the policy of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and they were delighted with your dissensions, thinking that you would mutually destroy each other. When they saw you the master of an army, they complimented you as a young man with specious and inexpensive honours. When they saw that you were more proud and self-restrained in respect of honours than they had supposed, and especially when you declined the magistracy that your army offered you, they were alarmed and appointed you to the command with us in order that we might draw your two experienced legions away from you, hoping that when one of you was vanquished the other would be weakened and isolated, and so the whole of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s party would be effaced and that of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> be restored to power. This is their chief aim.

76 1 "<persName n="234">Hirtius</persName> and I did what we were ordered to do, until we could humble <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who was much too arrogant; but we intended when he was vanquished to bring him into alliance with you and thus to pay the debt of gratitude we owed to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s friendship, the only payment that could be serviceable to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s party hereafter. It was not possible to communicate this to you before, but now that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> is vanquished and <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName> dead, and I am about to pay the debt of nature, the time for speaking has come, not that you may be grateful to me after my death, but that you, born to a happy destiny, as your deeds proclaim, may know what is for your own interest, and know that the course taken by <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName> and myself was a matter of necessity. The army that you yourself gave to us should most properly be given back to you, and I do give it. If you can take and hold the new levies, I will give you those also. If they are too much in awe of the Senate (for their officers were sent to act as spies upon us), and if the task would be an invidious one, the quaestor <persName n="576">Torquatus</persName> will take command of them." After speaking thus he formally transferred the new levies to the quaestor and expired. The quaestor transferred them to <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> as the Senate had ordered. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> sent the bodies of <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName> and <persName n="396">Pansa</persName> with honours to Rome, where they received a public funeral.

77 1 The following events took place in Syria and Macedonia about the same time. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, when he passed through Syria, left a legion there, as he was already contemplating an expedition against the Parthians. <persName n="85">Caecilius Bassus</persName> had charge of it, but the title of commander was held by <persName n="534">Sextus Caesar</persName>, a young man related to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself, who was given over to dissipation and who led the legion around everywhere in an indecorous manner. Once when <persName n="85">Caecilius Bassus</persName> reproved him, he replied insultingly, and some time later, when he called <persName n="85">Caecilius Bassus</persName> to him and the latter was slow in obeying, he ordered him to be dragged before him. A tumult and blows ensued. The soldiers would not tolerate the indignity and slew <persName n="534">Sextus Caesar</persName>. This act was followed by repentance and fear of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. Accordingly, they took an oath together that they would defend themselves to the death if they were not pardoned and restored to confidence, and they compelled <persName n="85">Caecilius Bassus</persName> to take the same oath. They also enlisted and drilled another legion as associates with themselves. This is one account of <persName n="85">Caecilius Bassus</persName>, but <persName n="265">Libo</persName> says that he belonged to the army of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and that after the latter's defeat he became a private citizen in Tyre, where he corrupted certain members of the legion, who slew <persName n="534">Sextus Caesar</persName> and chose <persName n="85">Caecilius Bassus</persName> for their leader. However that may have been, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> sent Murcius against him with three legions. <persName n="85">Caecilius Bassus</persName> defeated him badly. Finally, Murcius appealed to <persName n="320">Marcius Crispus</persName>, the governor of Bithynia, and the latter came to his aid with three legions.

78 1 While <persName n="85">Caecilius Bassus</persName> was besieged by the latter, <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> suddenly came up with them and took possession, not only of the two legions of <persName n="85">Caecilius Bassus</persName>, but also of the six that were besieging him, whose leaders surrendered in a friendly way and obeyed him as proconsul; for the Senate had decreed, as I have already said, that all [beyond the Adriatic] should obey <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>. Just then <persName n="15">Allienus</persName>, who had been sent to Egypt by <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, brought from that quarter four legions of soldiers dispersed by the disasters of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and of <persName n="133">Crassus</persName>, or left with <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName> by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> surrounded him unawares in Palestine and compelled him to surrender, as he did not dare to fight with four legions against eight. Thus <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> became the master, in a surprising way, of twelve legions, and laid siege to <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, who was coming from Asia with two legions and had been received in Laodicea in a friendly manner. The Senate was delighted when it heard the news.

79 1 In Macedonia <persName n="178">Gaius Antonius</persName>, the brother of Mark <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, with one legion of foot soldiers, contended with <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, and, being inferior in strength to the latter, laid an ambuscade for him. <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> avoided the trap, and, in his turn, laid an ambuscade, but he did no harm to those whom he caught in it, but ordered his own soldiers to salute their adversaries. Although the latter did not return the salutation or accept the courtesy, he allowed them to pass out of the trap unharmed. Then he went around by other roads and confronted them again at a precipice, and again did them no harm but saluted them. Then, regarding him as a saviour of his fellow citizens and as one deserving the reputation he had gained for wisdom and mildness, they conceived an admiration for him, saluted him, and passed over to him. <persName n="178">Gaius Antonius</persName> also surrendered himself and was treated with honour by <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> until he was convicted of having tried several times to corrupt the army, when he was put to death. Thus, including his former forces, <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> had possession of six legions, and since he approved the valour of the Macedonians he raised two legions among them, whom, too, he drilled in the Italian discipline.

80 1 Such was the state of affairs in Syria and Macedonia. In Italy <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, although he considered it an insult that <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, instead of himself, was chosen general against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, concealed his indignation and asked the honours of a triumph for his exploits. But being disdained by the Senate as though he were seeking honours beyond his years, he began to fear lest if <persName n="27">Antony</persName> were destroyed he should be despised still more, and so he desired the reconciliation with <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, which <persName n="396">Pansa</persName> on his death-bed had recommended to him. Accordingly, he began to make friends of the stragglers from <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s army, both officers and soldiers, enrolling them among his own troops, or if they wished to return to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> allowing them to do so, in order to show that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was not moved by implacable hatred against him. Having encamped near to <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName>, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s friend, who had command of three legions, he made him anxious, but performed no hostile act, and in like manner gave him the opportunity either to join himself or to go on unmolested with his army to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and chide him for ignoring their common interests. <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName> took the hint and proceeded to join <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. <persName n="146">Decius</persName> also, one of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s officers, who had been taken prisoner at Mutina, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> treated with honour, allowing him to return to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> if he wished, and when <persName n="146">Decius</persName> asked what were his sentiments toward <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, he said that he had given plenty of indications to persons of discernment and that even more would be insufficient for fools.

81 1 After conveying these hints to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> wrote still more plainly to <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> and <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> concerning the indignities put upon himself and the rapid advancement of the murderers, causing them to fear, lest to secure the favour of the Pompeian faction, each of the <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>ians should one by one be treated like <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, since he too was suffering the consequences of his folly and contempt of this fear. He advised that, for the sake of appearances, they should obey the Senate, but that they should confer together for their own safety while they could still do so, and reproach <persName n="27">Antony</persName> for his conduct; that they should follow the example of their own soldiers, who did not separate even when they were discharged from the service but, in order that they might not be exposed to the assaults of enemies, preferred for the sake of strength to settle together in groups upon the conquered territory, rather than to enjoy their own homes singly. This is what <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> wrote to <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> and <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName>. But the first soldiers of <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> fell sick by reason of excessive eating after their famine, and suffered from dysentery, and the newer ones were still undrilled. <persName n="378">Plancus</persName> soon joined him with his own army, and then <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> wrote to the Senate that he would hunt down <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who was now a wanderer; certain small naval actions having already taken place.23

82 1 When the Pompeians learned what had happened an astonishing number showed themselves to be of that party; they exclaimed that their ancestral freedom had at last been regained: they each offered sacrifices, and decemvirs, too, were chosen to examine the accounts of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s magistracy. This was a preliminary step to annulling <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s arrangements, for <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had done little or nothing himself, but had conducted all the affairs of state in accordance with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s memoranda. The Senate knew this well, but it hoped that by finding a pretext for annulling a part of the measures it would be enabled in the same way to annul the whole. The decemvirs gave public notice that whoever had received anything in the course of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s government should make it known in writing immediately, and threatened any who should disobey. The Pompeians also sought the consulship for the remainder of the year in place of <persName n="234">Hirtius</persName> and <persName n="396">Pansa</persName>; but <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> also sought it, applying not to the Senate, but to <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> privately, whom he urged to become his colleague, saying that <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> should carry on the government, as he was the elder and more experienced, and that he himself desired to enjoy the title only, as a means by which he could dismiss his army in a becoming manner, and that this was the reason he had previously asked the honour of a triumph. <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, whose desire for office was excited by this proposal, said to the Senate that he understood that a negotiation was on foot among the generals commanding the provinces, and he advised that they should conciliate the man whom they had treated with disdain and who was still at the head of a large army, and allow him to hold office in the city, notwithstanding his youth, rather than that he should remain under arms in a state of resentment. But lest he should do anything contrary to the interests of the Senate, <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> proposed that some man of prudence from among the older ones should be chosen as his colleague to be a firm guardian of the immature nature of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>.

The senate laughed at <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>'s ambition, and the relatives of the murderers especially opposed him, fearing lest <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, as consul, should bring the murderers to punishment, 83 1 but on various accounts the election was postponed by certain legal objections. Meanwhile, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> passed over the Alps with the permission of <persName n="137">Culleo</persName>, who had been stationed there by <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> to guard them, and advanced to a river where <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> was encamped; but he neglected to surround himself with palisade and ditch, as though he were camping alongside a friend. Messengers were going to and fro between them constantly. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> reminded <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> of their friendship and of his various good offices, pointing out that after he himself should be destroyed all who had enjoyed <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s friendship would suffer a like fate, one by one: <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> feared the Senate, which had ordered him to make war on <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, but he promised nevertheless that he would not do so willingly. The army of <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, having respect for <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s dignity and perceiving the messengers going to and fro, and being gratified with the simplicity of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s camp, mingled with his men, at first secretly, then openly, as with fellow-citizens and fellow-soldiers; they disregarded the orders of the tribunes, who forbade their doing so; and in order to facilitate their intercourse they made a bridge of boats across the river. The Tenth Legion, which had been originally enlisted by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, arranged things for him inside the camp of <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>.

84 1 When <persName n="258">Laterensis</persName>, one of the distinguished members of the Senate, perceived this, he warned <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>. As the latter was incredulous <persName n="258">Laterensis</persName> advised him to divide his army in several parts and send them away on some ostensible errands in order to test whether they were faithful or not. Accordingly, <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> divided them in three parts, and ordered them to go out by night in order to protect some convoys who were approaching. About the last watch the soldiers armed themselves as if for the march, seized the fortified parts of the camp, and opened the gates to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. He came running to the tent of <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, whose whole army now escorted him, demanding from <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> peace and compassion for their unfortunate fellow-citizens. <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> leaped out of bed among them ungirt, just as he was, promised to do what they asked, embraced <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and pleaded necessity as his excuse. Some say that he actually fell on his knees before <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, being an irresolute and timid man. Not all writers put faith in this report, nor do I, for he had as yet done nothing whatever inimical to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> which might cause him fear. Thus did <persName n="27">Antony</persName> again become a very powerful man, and most formidable to his enemies; for he had the army with which he had abandoned the siege of Mutina, including its magnificent cavalry; <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName> had joined him on the road with three legions, and <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> had become his ally with seven legions of foot soldiers and a great number of auxiliary troops and apparatus in proportion. <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> nominally retained the command of these, but <persName n="27">Antony</persName> directed everything.

85 1 When these facts became known at Rome another wonderful and sudden change took place. Those who had just now held <persName n="27">Antony</persName> in contempt were alarmed, while the fears of others were changed to courage. The edicts of the decemvirs were torn down with derision, and the consular election was still further postponed. The Senate, wholly at a loss what to do and fearful lest <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> should form an alliance, secretly sent two of their number, <persName n="272">Lucius</persName> and <persName n="396">Pansa</persName>, to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, under pretence of attending the games in Greece, to urge them to lend all the assistance possible. It recalled from Africa two of the three legions under <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName>, and ordered the third to be given over to <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName>, who commanded another portion of Africa, and favoured the senatorial party, although they knew that these legions had served under <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and although they suspected everything of his, but their embarrassment drove them to this, since they even appointed, awkwardly enough, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> as general with <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, for they feared lest he should unite with <persName n="27">Antony</persName>.

86 1 But <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> excited the army to anger against the Senate both on account of its repeated indignities towards himself, and for requiring the soldiers to undertake a second campaign before paying them the 5000 drachmas per man which it had promised to give them for the first. He advised them to send and ask for the money. They sent their centurions. The Senate understood that the men had been advised to this course by <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and said that they would make answer also by deputies. They sent these, under instructions, to address themselves, when <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was not present, to the two legions which had deserted from <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and to advise the soldiers not to rest their hopes on a single person, but on the Senate, which alone had perpetual power, and to go to the camp of <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, where they would find the promised money. Having delivered this charge to the deputies they forwarded one-half of the donative and appointed ten men to divide it, to whom it did not add <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> even as an eleventh. As the two legions refused to meet them without <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, the deputies returned without effecting anything. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> no longer held communication with the troops through the medium of others, and no longer asked them to wait, but assembled the army and came before them and related to them the indignities he had suffered from the Senate, and its purpose to destroy all the friends of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, one by one: he admonished them also to beware against being transferred to a general opposed to their party and being sent to one war after another to be killed or set in opposition to each other. This, he said, was the reason why, after their common struggles at Mutina were ended, rewards were given to only two legions, in order to induce strife and sedition among them.

87 1 "You know, too," he said, "the reason why <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was lately vanquished: you have heard what the Pompeians in the city did to those who had received certain gifts from <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. What confidence can you have of keeping the lands and money you have received from him, or what confidence can I have in my own safety, while the relatives of the murderers thus dominate the Senate? For my part I shall accept my fate, whatever it may be, for it is honourable to suffer anything in the service of a father; but I fear for you, such a host of brave men, who have incurred danger in behalf of me and my father. You know that I have been free from ambition from the time when I declined the praetorship which you offered me with the insignia of that office. I see only one path of safety now for both of us: if I should obtain the consulship by your help. In that case all my father's gifts to you will be confirmed, the colonies that are still due to you will be forthcoming, and all your rewards will be paid in full; and I should bring the murderers to punishment and release you from any more wars."

88 1 At these words the army cheered heartily, and forthwith sent their centurions to ask the consulship for <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. When the Senate began to make talk about his youth, the centurions replied, as they had been instructed, that in the olden times <persName n="128">Corvinus</persName> had held the office and at a later period the xxxxx, both the elder and the younger, before the legal age, and that the country profited much from the youth of each. They instanced, as recent examples, <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> and said that it had been granted to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself to stand for the consulship ten years before the legal age.24 While the centurions were arguing with much boldness, some of the senators, who could not endure that centurions should use such freedom of speech, rebuked them for exceeding the bounds of military discipline. When the army heard of this, they were still more exasperated and demanded to be led immediately to the city, saying that they would hold a special election and raise <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> to the consulship because he was <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s son. At the same time they extolled the elder <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> without stint. When <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> saw them in this excited state, he led them directly from the assembly, eight legions of foot and a corresponding number of horse, and the auxiliary troops that were serving with the legions. Having crossed the river Rubicon from the Gallic province into Italy, — the stream that his father crossed in like manner at the beginning of the civil war, — he divided his army in two parts. One of these divisions he ordered to follow in a leisurely way. The other and better one, consisting of picked men, made forced marches, hastening in order to take the city unprepared. Meeting a convoy on the road with part of the money which the Senate had sent as a present to the soldiers, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> feared the effect it might have on his mercenaries. So he secretly sent forward a force to scare away the convoy, and they took to flight with the money.

89 1 When the news of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s approach reached the city there was immense confusion and alarm. People ran hither and thither, and some conveyed their wives and children and whatever they held most dear to the country and to the fortified parts of the city, for it was not yet known that he aimed only at securing the consulship. Having heard that an army was advancing with hostile intentions, there was nothing that they did not fear. The Senate was struck with consternation since they had no military force in readiness. As is usual in cases of panic they blamed each other. Some complained that they had insolently deprived <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> of the command of the campaign against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, others that they had treated with contempt his demand for a triumph, a request which was not without justice; others because they had envied him the honour of distributing the money; others because he had not been made an additional member of the board of ten: still others said that they had made the army hostile because the gifts voted to them had not been quickly and fully paid. They complained especially of the inopportune time for such a strife, while <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> were far away and their forces not yet organized, and on their own flank in a hostile attitude were <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, who, they thought, might form an alliance with <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and thus their fears were greatly augmented. <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, who had so long been in evidence, was nowhere to be seen.

90 1 There was a sudden change on all hands. Instead of 2500 drachmas 5000 were given; instead of two legions only, the entire eight were to be paid. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was appointed to make the distribution instead of the ten commissioners, and he was allowed to be a candidate for the consulship while absent. Messengers were hastily despatched to tell him these things. Directly after they had left the city the Senate repented. They felt that they ought not to be so weakly terror-stricken, or accept a new tyranny without bloodshed, or accustom those seeking office to gain it by violence, or the soldiers to govern the country by the word of command. Rather should they arm themselves as best they could and confront the invaders with the laws, for there was some hope that, if they were confronted with the laws, not even they would bear arms against their country. If they should do so, it would be best to endure a siege until <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> and <persName n="378">Plancus</persName> should come to the rescue, and to defend themselves to the death rather than submit voluntarily to a slavery thenceforth without remedy. They recounted the high spirit and endurance in behalf of freedom of the Romans of old, who never yielded to anything when their liberty was at stake.

91 1 As both the legions sent for from Africa happened to arrive in the harbour on this very day, it seemed as though the gods were urging them to defend their freedom. Their regret for what they had done was confirmed; <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> again made his appearance, and they repealed all the decrees above mentioned. All who were of military age were called to arms, also the two legions from Africa, and 1000 horse with them, and another legion that <persName n="396">Pansa</persName> had left behind, — all these were assigned to their proper places. Some of them guarded the hill called the Janiculum, where the money was stored, others held the bridge over the Tiber, and the city praetors were put in command of the separate divisions. Others made ready small boats and ships in the harbour, together with money, in case they should be vanquished and have to escape by sea. While courageously making these hasty preparations they hoped to alarm <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> in his turn, and induce him to seek the consulship from them instead of the army, or they hoped at least to defend themselves vigorously. They hoped also to change those of the opposite faction as soon as it became a contest for liberty. They sought for the mother and sister of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, but as they did not discover them either by any open or secret search, they were again alarmed at finding themselves deprived of such important hostages, and as the <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>ians showed no disposition to yield to them they concluded that it was by them that these women were being carefully concealed.

92 1 While <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was still giving audience to the messengers, it was announced to him that the decrees had been rescinded. The messengers thereupon withdrew, covered with confusion. With his army still more exasperated <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> hastened to the city, fearing lest some evil should befall his mother and sister. To the plebeians, who were in a state of consternation, he sent horsemen in advance to tell them to have no fear. While all were amazed he took a position just beyond the Quirinal hill, no one daring to fight or prevent him. Now another wonderful and sudden change took place. Patricians flocked out and saluted him; the common people ran also and took the good order of the soldiers for a sign of peace. On the following day <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> advanced toward the city, leaving his army where it was, and having with him only a sufficient guard. Here, again, detached crowds met him along the whole road and saluted him, omitting nothing that savoured of friendliness and weak compliance. His mother and sister, who were in the temple of Vesta with the Vestal virgins, embraced him. The three legions, in spite of their generals, sent ambassadors and transferred themselves to him. One of the generals in command of them, <persName n="127">Cornutus</persName>, killed himself; the others allied themselves with <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. When <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> learned of the truce he sought an interview with <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> through friends. When it was granted he defended himself and dwelt much upon his proposing <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> for the consulship, as he had done in the Senate on a former occasion. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> answered ironically that <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> seemed to be the last of his friends to greet him.

93 1 The next night a rumour gained currency that two of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s legions, the Martian and the Fourth, had gone over to the side of the republic, saying that they had been deceived and led against their country. The praetors and the Senate put faith in this report heedlessly, although the army was very near, thinking that with the assistance of these two legions, as they were the bravest, it would be possible to hold out against the rest of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s army until some force from elsewhere should come to the rescue. The same night they sent <persName n="324">Marcus Aquilius Crassus</persName> to Picenum to raise troops, and ordered one of the tribunes, named <persName n="548">Apuleius</persName>, to run through the city and proclaim the good news to the people. The senators assembled by night in the senate-house, and <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> received them at the door, but when the news was contradicted he took flight in a litter.

94 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> laughed at them and moved his army nearer to the city and stationed it in the Campus Martius. He did not then punish any of the praetors, not even <persName n="324">Marcus Aquilius Crassus</persName>, who had rushed off to Picenum, although the latter was brought before him just as he was caught, in the disguise of a slave, but he pardoned all in order to acquire a reputation for clemency. But not long afterward they were put on the list of the proscribed. He ordered that the public money on the Janiculum or elsewhere be brought to him, and the amount which had been previously ordered to be paid to the army on the motion of <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, he distributed, namely 2500 drachmas per man, and promised to give them the remainder. Then he took his departure from the city until consuls should be chosen by the comitia. Having been elected himself, together with <persName n="401">Pedius</persName>, the man whom he desired to have as his colleague, and who had given to him his own portion of his inheritance from <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, he entered the city again as consul. While he offered the sacrifices, twelve vultures were seen; the same number, they say, that appeared to Romulus when he laid the foundations of the city. After the sacrifices he caused his adoption by his father to be ratified again, according to the lex curiata, — (it is possible to have adoption ratified by the people) — for the parts into which the tribes, or local divisions, are divided are called curiae, just as, I suppose, the similar divisions among the Greeks are called phratriae. Among the Romans this was the method of adoption most in accordance with law in the case of orphans; and those who follow it have the same rights as real sons in respect of the relatives and the freedmen of the persons who adopt them. Among the other splendid accessories of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was a large number of freedmen, many of them rich, and this was perhaps the principal reason why <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> wanted the adoption by a vote of the people in addition to the former adoption which came to him by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s will.

95 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> caused a new law to be passed to repeal the one which declared <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> a public enemy, and also to punish the murder of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. Indictments were found forthwith, the friends of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> bringing accusations against some for the act and others for guilty knowledge. This last charge was even brought against some who were not in the city when <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was killed. One day was fixed by public proclamation for the trial of all, and judgment was taken against all by default, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> presiding over the court, and none of the judges voting for acquittal except one patrician, who then escaped with impunity, but a little later was included with the others in the proscription. It appears that about this time <persName n="471">Quintus Gallius</persName>, a city praetor and brother of <persName n="334">Marcus Gallius</persName>, who was serving with <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, asked <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> for the command of Africa, and having thus got his chance, plotted against <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. His colleagues stripped him of his praetorship, the people tore his house down, and the Senate condemned him to death. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> ordered him to depart to his brother, and it is said that he took ship and was never seen again.

96 1 These things accomplished, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> formed his plans for a reconciliation with <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, for he had learned that <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> had already collected twenty legions of soldiers, and he needed <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s help against them. He moved out of the city toward the Adriatic coast and proceeded in a leisurely way, waiting to see what the Senate would do. <persName n="401">Pedius</persName> persuaded the senators, after <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had taken his departure, not to make their differences with each other irremediable, but to be reconciled to <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. Although they foresaw that such a reconciliation would not be for their advantage or for that of the country, but would be merely an assistance to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> against <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, nevertheless, they gave their approval and assent to it as a matter of necessity. So the decrees declaring <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, and the soldiers under them, public enemies, were repealed, and others of a peaceful nature were sent to them. Thereupon <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> wrote and congratulated them, and he promised to lend assistance to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> against <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> if he needed it. They replied to him at once in a friendly spirit and eulogized him. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> wrote that he would himself punish <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> on <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s account and <persName n="378">Plancus</persName> on his own, and that then he would join forces with <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>.

97 1 Such were the letters which they exchanged with each other. While pursuing <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was joined by <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> with two legions. <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> also brought about an arrangement with <persName n="378">Plancus</persName>, by virtue of which <persName n="378">Plancus</persName> passed over to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> with three legions, so that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> now had much the strongest force. <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> had ten legions, of whom four, the most experienced in war, had suffered severely from famine and were still enfeebled; while the other six were new levies, still untrained and unaccustomed to their labours, so, as he despaired of fighting, he decided to flee to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> in Macedonia. He retreated not by this side of the Apennines, but toward Ravenna and Aquileia. But since <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was travelling by this route, <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> proposed another longer and more difficult one — to cross the Rhine and traverse the wild country of barbarian tribes. Thereupon the new levies, bewildered and fatigued, were the first to desert him and join <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>; after them the four older legions joined <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and the auxiliaries did the same, except a body-guard of Gallic horse. Then Decimus allowed those who wished to do so to return to their own homes, and, after distributing among them the gold he had with him, proceeded toward the Rhine with 300 followers, the only ones who remained. As it was difficult to cross the river with so few, he was now abandoned by these also except ten. He put on Gallic clothing, and, as he was acquainted with the language, he proceeded on his journey with these, passing himself off as a Gaul. He no longer followed the longer route, but went toward Aquileia, thinking that he should escape notice by reason of the smallness of his force.25

98 1 Having been captured by robbers and bound, he asked them who was the chief of this Gallic tribe. He was informed that it was <persName n="97">Camilus</persName>, a man to whom he had done many favours; so he told them to bring him to <persName n="97">Camilus</persName>. When the latter saw him led in, he greeted him in a friendly way in public, and scolded those who had bound him for putting an indignity on so great a man through ignorance; but secretly he sent word to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was somewhat touched by this change of fortune, and was not willing to see <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, but he ordered <persName n="97">Camilus</persName> to kill him and send his head to himself. When he saw the head he ordered his attendants to bury it. Such was the end of <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName>, who had been <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s praefect of horse and had governed Narbonensian Gaul under him and had been designated by him for the consulship the coming year and for the governorship of the other Gaul. He was the next of the murderers after <persName n="579">Trebonius</persName> to meet punishment, within a year and a half of the assassination. About the same time <persName n="371">Minucius Basilus</persName>, another of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s murderers, was killed by his slaves, some of whom he was mutilating by way of punishment.

1 1 Thus was punishment visited upon two of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s murderers, who were conquered in their own provinces, <persName n="579">Trebonius</persName> in Asia and <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> in Gaul. How vengeance overtook <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, who were the principal leaders in the conspiracy against <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and who controlled the territory from Syria to Macedonia, and had large forces of cavalry and sailors, and more than twenty legions of infantry, together with ships and money, this fourth book of the Civil Wars will show. During the progress of these events came the pursuit and capture of the proscribed in Rome and the sufferings consequent thereon, the like of which cannot be recalled among the civil commotions or wars of the Greeks, or those of the Romans themselves save only in the time of <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, who was the first to put his enemies on a proscription list. For <persName n="602">Marius</persName> searched for his and punished those whom he found, but <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> proclaimed large rewards to persons who should kill the proscribed and severe punishment to those who should conceal them. But what took place in the time of <persName n="602">Marius</persName> and <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> I have previously narrated in the history relating to them. The sequel to my previous book is as follows.

2 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> composed their differences on a small, depressed islet in the river Lavinius, near the city of Mutina. Each had five legions of soldiers whom they stationed opposite each other, after which each proceeded with 300 men to the bridges over the river. <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> by himself went before them, searched the island, and waved his military cloak as a signal to them to come. Then each left his three hundred in charge of friends on the bridges and advanced to the middle of the island in plain sight, and there the three sat together in council, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> in the centre because he was consul. They were in conference from morning till night for two days, and came to these decisions: that <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> should resign the consulship and that <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName> should take it for the remainder of the year; that a new magistracy for quieting the civil dissensions should be created by law, which <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> should hold for five years with consular power (for this name seemed preferable to that of dictator, perhaps because of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s decree abolishing the dictatorship); that these three should at once designate the yearly magistrates of the city for the five years; that a distribution of the provinces should be made, giving to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> the whole of Gaul except the part bordering the Pyrenees Mountains, which was called Old Gaul; this, together with Spain, was assigned to <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>; while <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was to have Africa, Sardinia, and Sicily, and the other islands in the vicinity thereof.

3 1 Thus was the dominion of the Romans divided by the triumvirate among themselves. Only the assignment of the parts beyond the Adriatic was postponed, since these were still under the control of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, against whom <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> were to wage war. <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> was to be consul the following year and to remain in the city to do what was needful there, meanwhile governing Spain by proxy. He was to retain three of his legions to guard the city, and to divide the other seven between <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, three to the former and four to the latter, so that each of them might lead twenty legions to the war. To encourage the army with expectation of booty they promised them, beside other gifts, eighteen cities of Italy as colonies — cities which excelled in wealth, in the splendour of their estates and houses, and which were to be divided among them (land, buildings, and all), just as though they had been captured from an enemy in war. The most renowned among these were Capua, Rhegium, Venusia, Beneventum, Nuceria, Ariminum, and Vibo. Thus were the most beautiful parts of Italy marked out for the soldiers. But they decided to destroy their personal enemies beforehand, so that the latter should not interfere with their arrangements while they were carrying on war abroad. Having come to these decisions, they reduced them to writing, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> as consul communicated them to the soldiers, all except the list of proscriptions. When the soldiers heard them they applauded and embraced each other in token of mutual reconciliation.

4 1 While these transactions were taking place many fearful prodigies and portents were observed at Rome. Dogs howled continuously like wolves — a fearful sign. Wolves darted through the forum — an animal unused to the city. Cattle uttered a human voice. A newly born infant spoke. Sweat issued from statues; some even sweated blood. Loud voices of men were heard and the clashing of arms and the tramp of horses where none could be seen. Many fearful signs were observed around the sun, there were showers of stones, and continuous lightning fell upon the sacred temples and images; and in consequence of these things the Senate sent for diviners and soothsayers from Etruria. The oldest of them said that the kingly rule of the former times was coming back, and that they would all be slaves except only himself, whereupon he closed his mouth and held his breath till he was dead.

5 1 As soon as the triumvirs were by themselves they joined in making a list of those who were to be put to death. They put on the list those whom they suspected because of their power, and also their personal enemies, and they exchanged their own relatives and friends with each other for death, both then and later. For they made additions to the catalogue from time to time, in some cases on the ground of enmity, in others for a grudge merely, or because their victims were friends of their enemies or enemies of their friends, or on account of their wealth, for the triumvirs needed a great deal of money to carry on the war, since the revenue from Asia had been paid to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, who were still collecting it, and the kings and satraps were contributing. So the triumvirs were short of money because Europe, and especially Italy, was exhausted by wars and exactions; for which reason they levied very heavy contributions from the plebeians and finally even from women, and contemplated taxes on sales and rents. By now, too, some were proscribed because they had handsome villas or city residences. The number of senators who were sentenced to death and confiscation was about 300, and of the knights about 2000. There were brothers and uncles of the triumvirs in the list of the proscribed, and also some of the officers serving under them who had had some difficulty with the leaders, or with their fellow-officers.

6 1 As they left the conference to proceed to Rome they postponed the proscription of the greater number of victims, but they decided to send executioners in advance and without warning to kill twelve, or, as some say, seventeen, of the most important ones, among whom was <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>. Four of these were slain immediately, either at banquets or as they were met on the streets; and when search was made for the others in temples and houses, there was a sudden panic which lasted through the night, and a running to and fro with cries and lamentation as in a captured city. When it was known that men were being seized and massacred, although there was no list of those who had been previously sentenced, every man thought that he was the one whom the pursuers were in search of. Thus in despair some were on the point of burning their own houses, and others the public buildings, or of choosing some terrible deed in their frenzied state before the blow should fall upon them; and they would perhaps have done so had not the consul <persName n="401">Pedius</persName> hurried around with heralds and encouraged them, telling them to wait till daylight and get more accurate information. When morning came <persName n="401">Pedius</persName>, contrary to the intention of the triumvirs, published the list of seventeen as being deemed the sole authors of the civil strife and the only ones condemned. To the rest he pledged the public faith, being ignorant of the determinations of the triumvirs.

<persName n="401">Pedius</persName> died in consequence of fatigue the following night, 7 1 and the triumvirs entered the city separately on three successive days, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, each with his praetorian cohort and one legion. As they arrived, the city was speedily filled with arms and military standards, disposed in the most advantageous places. A public assembly was forthwith convened in the midst of these armed men, and a tribune, <persName n="456">Publius Titius</persName>, proposed a law providing for a new magistracy for settling the present disorders, to consist of three men to hold office for five years, namely, <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, with the same power as consuls. (Among the Greeks these would be called harmosts, which is the name the Lacedaemonians gave to those whom they appointed over their subject states.) No time was given for scrutiny of this measure, nor was a fixed day appointed for voting on it, but it was passed forthwith. That same night, the proscription of 130 men in addition to the seventeen was proclaimed in various parts of the city, and a little later 150 more, and additions to the lists were constantly made of those who were condemned later or previously killed by mistake, so that they might seem to have perished justly. It was ordered that the heads of all the victims should be brought to the triumvirs at a fixed reward, which to a free person was payable in money and to a slave in both money and freedom. All were required to afford opportunity for searching their houses. Those who received fugitives, or concealed them, or refused to allow search to be made, were liable to the same penalties as the proscribed, and those who informed against concealers were allowed the same rewards [as those who killed the proscribed].

8 1 The proscription was in the following words: "<persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, chosen by the people to set in order and regulate the republic, do declare that, had not perfidious traitors begged for mercy and when they obtained it become the enemies of their benefactors and conspired against them, neither would <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> have been slain by those whom he saved by his clemency after capturing them in war, whom he admitted to his friendship and upon whom he heaped offices, honours, and gifts; nor should we have been compelled to use this wide-spread severity against those who have insulted us and declared us public enemies. Now, seeing that the malice of those who have conspired against us and by whose hands <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> suffered, cannot be mollified by kindness, we prefer to anticipate our enemies rather than suffer at their hands. Let no one who sees what both <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and ourselves have suffered consider our action unjust, cruel, or immoderate. Although <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was clothed with supreme power, although he was pontifex maximus, although he had overthrown and added to our sway the nations most formidable to the Romans, although he was the first man to attempt the untried sea beyond the pillars of Hercules and was the discoverer of a country hitherto unknown to the Romans, this man was slain in the midst of the senate-house, which is designated as sacred, under the eyes of the gods, with twenty-three dastardly wounds, by men whom he had taken prisoners in war and spared, while some of them he had named as co-heirs of his wealth. After this execrable crime, instead of arresting the guilty wretches, the rest sent them forth as commanders and governors, in which capacity they seized upon the public money, with which they are collecting an army against us and are seeking reinforcements from barbarians ever hostile to Roman rule. Cities subject to Rome that would not obey them they have burned, or ravaged, or levelled to the ground; other cities they have forced by terror to bear arms against the country and against us.

9 1 "Some of them we have punished already; and by the aid of divine providence you shall presently see the rest punished. Although the chief part of this work has been finished by us or is well under control, namely the settlement of Spain and Gaul as well as matters here in Italy, one task still remains, and that is to march against <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s assassins beyond the sea. On the eve of undertaking this foreign war for you, we do not consider it safe, either for you or for us, to leave other enemies behind to take advantage of our absence and watch for opportunities during the war; nor again do we think that there should be delay on their account, but that we ought rather to sweep them out of our pathway, once for all, seeing that they began the war against us when they voted us and the armies under us public enemies.

10 1 "What vast numbers of citizens have they, on their part, doomed to destruction with us, disregarding the vengeance of the gods and the reprobation of mankind! We shall not deal harshly with any multitude of men, nor shall we count as enemies all who have opposed us or plotted against us, or those distinguished for their riches merely, their abundance, or their high position; nor shall we slay as many as another man who held the supreme power before us, when he, too, was regulating the commonwealth in civil convulsions, and whom you named the Fortunate on account of his success; and yet necessarily three persons will have more enemies than one. We shall take vengeance only on the worst and most guilty. This we shall do for your interest no less than for our own, for while we keep up our conflicts you will all be involved necessarily in great dangers, and it is necessary for us also to do something to quiet the army, which has been insulted, irritated, and decreed a public enemy by our common foes. Although we might arrest on the spot whomsoever we had determined on, we prefer rather to proscribe rather than seize them unawares; and this, too, on your account, so that it may not be in the power of enraged soldiers to exceed their orders against persons not responsible, but that they may be restricted to a certain number designated by name, and spare the others according to order.

11 1 "So be it then!1 Let no one harbour any one of those whose names are hereto appended, or conceal them, or send them away, or be corrupted by their money. Whoever shall be detected in saving, or aiding, or conniving with them we will put on the list of the proscribed without allowing any excuse or pardon. Let those who kill the proscribed bring us their heads and receive the following rewards: to a free man 25,000 Attic drachmas per head; to a slave his freedom and 10,000 Attic drachmas and his master's right of citizenship. Informers shall receive the same rewards. In order that they may remain unknown the names of those who receive the rewards shall not be inscribed in our registers." Such was the language of the proscription of the triumvirate as nearly as it can be rendered from Latin into Greek.

12 1 <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> was the first to begin the work of proscription, and his brother <persName n="275">Lucius Aemilius Paulus</persName> was the first on the list of the proscribed. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> came next, and the second name on the list was that of his uncle, <persName n="282">Lucius Caesar</persName>. These two men had been the first to vote <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> public enemies. The third and fourth victims were relatives of the consuls-elect for the coming year, namely, <persName n="418">Plautius</persName>, the brother of <persName n="378">Plancus</persName>, and <persName n="460">Quinctius</persName>, the father-in‑law of <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName>. These four were placed at the head of the list, not only on account of their dignity as to produce terror and despair, so that none of the proscribed might hope to escape. Among the proscribed was <persName n="560">Thoranius</persName>, who was said by some to have been a tutor of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. When the lists were published, the gates and all the other exits from the city, the harbour, the marshes, the pools, and every other place that was suspected as adapted to flight or concealment, were occupied by soldiers; the centurions were charged to scour the surrounding country. All these things took place simultaneously.

13 1 Straightway, throughout city and country, wherever each one happened to be found, there were sudden arrests and murder in various forms, decapitations for the sake of the rewards when the head should be shown, and undignified flights in disguises which strangely contrasted with former splendour. Some descended into wells, others into filthy sewers. Some took refuge in chimneys. Others crouched in the deepest silence under the thickly-packed tiles of their roofs. For some were not less fearful of their wives and ill-disposed children than of the murderers, while others feared their freedmen and their slaves; creditors feared their debtors and neighbours feared neighbours who coveted their lands. There was a sudden outburst of previously smouldering hates and a shocking change in the condition of senators, consulars, praetors, tribunes (men who were about to enter upon those offices, or who had already held them), who threw themselves with lamentations at the feet of their own slaves, giving to the servant the character of saviour and master. But the most lamentable thing was that even after this humiliation they did not obtain pity.

14 1 Every kind of calamity was rife, but not as in ordinary sedition or military occasion: for in those cases the people had to fear only the members of the opposite faction, or the enemy, but could rely on their own households; but now they were more afraid of these than of the assassins, for as the former had nothing to fear on their own account, as in ordinary seditions or wars, they were suddenly transformed from domestics into enemies, either from some concealed hatred, or in order to obtain published rewards, or to possess themselves of the gold and silver in their masters' houses. For these reasons each one became treacherous to his master, preferring his own gain to compassion for him, and those who were faithful and well-disposed feared to aid, or conceal, or connive at the escape of the victims, because such acts made them liable to the very same punishments. This was quite different from the peril that befell the seventeen men first condemned. Then there was no proscription, but certain persons were arrested unexpectedly, and as all feared similar treatment all sheltered each other; but in the proscriptions some immediately became the prey of all, others, being free from danger themselves and eager for gain, became blood-hounds for the murderers for the sake of the rewards; while of the general throng, some plundered houses of the slain, and their private gains turned their thoughts away from the public calamities; others, more prudent and upright, were palsied with consternation. It seemed most astounding to them, when they reflected upon it, that while other states afflicted by civil strife had been rescued by harmonizing the factions, in this case the dissensions of the leaders had wrought ruin in the first instance and their agreement with each other had had like consequences afterwards.

15 1 Some died defending themselves against their slayers. Others made no resistance, considering the assailants not to blame. Some starved, or hanged, or drowned themselves, or flung themselves from their roofs into the fire. Some offered themselves to the murderers or sent for them when they delayed. Others concealed themselves and made abject entreaties, or tried to thrust aside the danger, or to buy themselves off. Some were killed by mistake, or by private malice, contrary to the intention of the triumvirs. It was evident that a corpse was not one of the proscribed if the head was still attached to it, for the heads of the proscribed were displayed on the rostra in the forum, where it was necessary to bring them in order to get the rewards. Equally conspicuous were the fidelity and courage of others — of wives, of children, of brothers, of slaves, who rescued the proscribed or planned for them in various ways, and died with them when they did not succeed in their designs. Some even killed themselves on the bodies of the slain. Of those who made their escape some perished by shipwreck, ill luck pursuing them to the last. Others were preserved, contrary to expectation, to become city magistrates, commanders in war, and even to enjoy the honours of a triumph. Such a display of paradoxes did this time afford.

16 1 These things took place not in an ordinary city, not in a weak and petty kingdom; but the evil deity thus shook the most powerful mistress of so many nations and of land and sea, and so brought about after a long period of time the present well ordered condition. Other like events had taken place in the time of <persName n="549">Sulla</persName> and even before him in that of Caius <persName n="602">Marius</persName>. The most notable of these calamities I have narrated in my history of those times, in which was the added horror that the dead were cast away unburied. The matters we are now considering are the more remarkable by reason of the dignity of the triumvirs and especially the character and good fortune of one of them, who established the government on a firm foundation, and left his lineage and the name which is now supreme after him. I shall now go over the most remarkable as well as the most shocking of these events, which are all the better to be remembered because they were the last of the kind. I shall not speak of all, however, because the mere killing, or flight, or subsequent return of those who were pardoned by the triumvirs at a later period and passed undistinguished lives at home, is not worthy of mention. I shall refer only to those which are most calculated to astonish by their extraordinary nature or to confirm what has already been said. These events are many, and they have been written in many books by many Roman historians successively. By way of summary, and to shorten my narrative, I shall record a few of each kind in order to confirm the truth of each and to illustrate the happiness of the present time.

17 1 The massacre began, as it happened, among those who were still in office, and the first one slain was the tribune <persName n="502">Salvius</persName>. His office was, according to the laws, sacred and inviolable, endowed with the greatest powers, so that tribunes have even imprisoned consuls. <persName n="502">Salvius</persName>, too, was the tribune who had at first prevented the Senate from declaring <persName n="27">Antony</persName> a public enemy, but later he had co-operated with <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> in everything. When he heard of the agreement of the triumvirs, and of their hastening to the city, he gave a banquet to his friends, believing that he should not have many more opportunities for doing so. Soldiers burst in while the feast was going on, some of the guests started up in tumultuous alarm, but the centurion in command ordered them to resume their places and remain quiet. Then, seizing <persName n="502">Salvius</persName> by the hair, just as he was, the centurion drew him as far as need be across the table, cut off his head, and ordered the guests to stay where they were and make no disturbance, unless they wished to suffer a like fate. So they remained even after the centurion's departure, stupefied and speechless, till the most silent watches of the night, reclining by the tribune's headless body. The second one slain was the praetor <persName n="370">Minucius</persName>, who was holding the comitia in the forum. Learning that the soldiers were seeking him, he leapt up, and while he was still running about looking for a hiding-place he changed his clothes, and then darted into a shop, sending away his attendants and the insignia of his office. The attendants, moved by shame and pity, lingered near the place, and thus unintentionally made the discovery of the praetor more easy to his slayers.

18 1 <persName n="19">Annalis</persName>, another praetor, was going around with his son, who was a candidate for the quaestorship, and soliciting votes for him. Some friends who accompanied <persName n="19">Annalis</persName>, and those who bore his insignia of office, when they heard that he was on the list of the proscribed, ran away from him. <persName n="19">Annalis</persName> took refuge with one of his clients, who had in the suburbs a small, mean apartment in every way despicable, where he remained safely concealed until his son, suspecting that he had fled to this client, guided the murderers to the place. The triumvirs gave him his father's fortune and raised him to the aedileship. As he was returning home drunk he fell into a quarrel about something, and was killed by the same soldiers who had killed his father.

<persName n="562">Thuranius</persName>, who was not then praetor but had been, and who was the father of a young man who was a scapegrace generally, but had great influence with <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, asked the centurions to postpone his death for a short time, till his son could appeal to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> for him. They laughed at him, and said, "He has already appealed, but on the other side." When the old man knew this he asked for another very short interval until he could see his daughter, and when he saw her he told her not to claim her share of the inheritance lest her brother should ask for her death also from <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. It happened that this man too, after squandering his fortune in disgraceful ways, in the end was convicted of theft and sentenced to banishment.

19 1 <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, who had held supreme power after <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s death, as much as a public speaker could, was proscribed, together with his <persName n="329">Marcus Cicero</persName>, his brother <persName n="466">Quintus Cicero</persName>, and his brother's son and all his household, his faction, and his friends. He fled in a small boat, but as he could not endure the sea-sickness, he landed and went to a country place of his own near Caieta, a town of Italy, which I visited to gain knowledge of this lamentable affair, and here he remained quiet. While the searchers were approaching (for of all others <persName n="27">Antony</persName> sought for him most eagerly and the rest did so for <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s sake), ravens flew into his chamber and awakened him from sleep by their croaking, and pulled off his bed-covering, until his servants, divining that this was a warning from one of the gods, put him in a litter and again conveyed him toward the sea, going cautiously through a dense thicket. Many soldiers were hurrying around in squads asking if <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> had been seen anywhere. Some people, moved by good-will and pity, said that he had already put to sea; but a shoemaker, a client of <persName n="117">Clodius</persName>, who had been a most bitter enemy of <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, pointed out the path to <persName n="255">Laena</persName>, the centurion, who was pursuing with a small force. The latter ran after him, and seeing slaves mustering for the defence in much larger number than the force under his own command, he called out by way of stratagem, "Centurions in the rear, to the front!"

Thereupon the slaves, thinking that more soldiers were coming, were terror-stricken, 20 1 and <persName n="255">Laena</persName>, although he had been once saved by <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> when under trial, drew his head out of the litter and cut it off, striking it three times, or rather sawing it off by reason of his inexperience. He also cut off the hand with which <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> had written the speeches against <persName n="27">Antony</persName> as a tyrant, which he had entitled Philippics in imitation of those of <persName n="151">Demosthenes</persName>. Then some of the soldiers hastened on horseback and others on shipboard to convey the good news quickly to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. The latter was sitting in front of the tribunal in the forum when <persName n="255">Laena</persName>, a long distance off, shewed him the head and hand by lifting them up and shaking them. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was delighted beyond measure. He crowned the centurion and gave him 250,000 Attic drachmas in addition to the stipulated reward for killing the man who had been his greatest and most bitter enemy. The head and hand of <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> were suspended for a long time from the rostra in the forum where formerly he had been accustomed to make public speeches, and more people came together to behold this spectacle than had previously come to listen to him. It is said that even at his meals <persName n="27">Antony</persName> placed the head of <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> before his table, until he became satiated with the horrid sight.

Thus was <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, a man famous even yet for his eloquence, and one who had rendered the greatest service to his country when he held the office of consul, slain, and insulted after his death. His son had been sent in advance to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> in Greece. <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>'s brother, <persName n="466">Quintus Cicero</persName>, was captured with his son. He begged the murderers to kill him before his son, and the son prayed that he might be killed before his father. The murderers said that they would grant both requests, and, dividing themselves into two parties, each taking one, killed them at the same time at a given signal.

21 1 The Egnatii, father and son, while embracing each other, died by one blow, and their heads were cut off while the remainder of their bodies were still locked together. <persName n="70">Balbus</persName> sent his son in advance of himself in flight toward the sea in order that they might not be too conspicuous travelling together, and he followed at a short interval. Somebody told him, either by design or by mistake, that his son had been captured. He went back and delivered himself to the murderers. It happened, too, that his son perished by shipwreck. Thus did evil destiny increase the calamities of the time. <persName n="49">Arruntius</persName> had a son who was not willing to fly without his father. The latter with difficulty persuaded him to seek his safety because he was young. His mother accompanied him to the city gates and returned only to bury her slain husband. When she learned that her son also had perished at sea she starved herself to death.

Let these serve as examples of sons good and bad. 22 1 As for brothers, two of the name of xxxxx, being proscribed together, hid themselves in an oven till their slaves found them, when one of them was killed and the other fled; when he learned that his brother had perished he threw himself from the bridge into the Tiber. Some fishermen seized him thinking that he had fallen into the water instead of leaping in. He stoutly resisted rescue and tried to throw himself into the river again; but when he was overcome by the fishermen he exclaimed "You are not saving me, but ruining yourself by helping one who is proscribed." Nevertheless they had pity on him and saved him until some soldiers who were guarding the bridge saw him, ran to him, and cut off his head. One of two other brothers threw himself into the river and one of his slaves searched for the body five days. At last he found it, and as it was still possible to recognize it, he cut off the head for the sake of the reward. The other brother had concealed himself in a dung-heap and another slave betrayed him. The murderers disdained to go into the heap, but thrust their spears into him and dragged him out, and then cut off his head, just as he was, without even washing it. Another one seeing his brother arrested ran up to him, not knowing that he was himself proscribed also, and said, "Kill me before him."2 The centurion, having the proscription list at hand, said, "Your request is a proper one, for your name comes before his." And so saying, he killed both of them in due order.

23 1 The above may serve as examples in the case of brothers. <persName n="268">Ligarius</persName> was concealed by his wife, who communicated the secret to only one female slave. Having been betrayed by the latter, she followed her husband's head as it was carried away, crying out, "I sheltered him; those who give shelter are to share the punishment." As nobody killed her or informed of her, she came to the triumvirs and accused herself before them. Being moved by her love for her husband they pretended not to see her, so she starved herself to death. I have mentioned her in this place, because she failed to save her husband and would not survive him. I shall refer to those who were successful in their devotion to their husbands when I speak of the men who escaped. Other women betrayed their husbands infamously. Among these was the wife of <persName n="516">Septimius</persName>, who had an amour with a certain friend of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. Being impatient to exchange this illicit connection for matrimony, she besought <persName n="27">Antony</persName> through her paramour to rid her of her husband. <persName n="516">Septimius</persName> was at once put on the list of the proscribed. When he learned this, in ignorance of this domestic treachery he fled to his wife's house. She, as though with loving anxiety, closed the doors, and kept him until the murderers came. The same day that her husband was killed she celebrated her new nuptials.

24 1 <persName n="498">Salassus</persName> escaped, and, not knowing what to do with himself, came back to the city by night, thinking that the danger had mostly passed away. His house had been sold. The janitor, who had been sold with the house, was the only one who recognized him, and he received him in his room, promising to conceal him and feed him as well as he could. <persName n="498">Salassus</persName> told the janitor to call his wife from her own house. She pretended to be very desirous to come, but to be fearful of the night and distrustful of her servants, and said that she would come at daybreak. When daylight came she went for the murderers, and the janitor, because she was delaying, ran to her house to hasten her coming, and <persName n="498">Salassus</persName>, when he had gone out, feared that he had gone to lay a plot against him, and went up to the roof to watch what would happen. Seeing not the janitor but his wife bringing the murderers, he precipitated himself from the roof. <persName n="173">Fulvius</persName> fled to the house of a female servant, who had been his mistress, and to whom he had given freedom and a dowry on her marriage. Although she had been so well treated by him she betrayed him on account of jealousy of the woman whom <persName n="173">Fulvius</persName> had married after his relations with her.

Let the above suffice as examples of depraved women. 25 1 <persName n="545">Statius</persName>, the Samnite, who had had great influence with the Samnites during the social war and who had been raised to the rank of a Roman senator for his noble deeds, his wealth, and his lineage, and who was now eighty years of age, was proscribed on account of his riches. He threw open his house to the people and to his own slaves to carry away whatever they pleased. He also scattered his property around with his own hand. When at last the house was empty he closed the doors, set fire to it, and perished, and the fire spread to many other parts of the city. Capito, through his half-opened door, for a long time resisted those who had been sent against him, killing them one by one. Finally, he was overpowered by numbers and slain after killing single-handed many of his assailants. <persName n="597">Vetulinus</persName> assembled around Rhegium a large force of the proscribed and those who had fled with them, and others from the eighteen cities which had been promised as rewards of victory to the soldiers and who were indignant at such treatment. With these men <persName n="597">Vetulinus</persName> slew the centurions who were scouting thereabouts, until a larger force was sent against him, and even then he did not desist, but passed over to Sicily and joined <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, who was master of that island and who received the fugitives. There he fought bravely until he was defeated in several engagements. Then he sent his son and the remainder of the proscribed with him to Messana, and when he saw that their boat was passing the straits he dashed upon the enemy and was cut in pieces.

26 1 <persName n="530">Sextius Naso</persName>, having been betrayed by a freedman who had been his favourite, snatched a sword from one of the soldiers, and, having killed his betrayer with it, surrendered himself to the murderers. A slave who was devoted to his master left the latter on a hill while he went to the sea-shore to hire a boat. On his return he saw his master being killed, and while he was breathing his last the slave called out to him, "Wait a moment, my master," whereupon he fell suddenly upon the centurion and slew him. Then he killed himself, saying to his master, "Now you have consolation." Lucius put money in the hands of his two most faithful freedmen and started for the sea-shore. They ran away with it, and he turned around, despairing of his life, and gave himself up to the murderers. <persName n="252">Labienus</persName>, who had captured and killed many persons in the time of the proscription of <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, thought that he would be disgraced if he did not bear a like fate bravely. So he went to his front door, seated himself in a chair, and waited for the murderers. <persName n="107">Cestius</persName> concealed himself in the fields among faithful slaves. When he saw centurions running hither and thither with weapons and the heads of the proscribed he could not endure the prolonged fear. He persuaded the slaves to light a funeral pyre, so that they might say that they were paying the last rites to the dead <persName n="107">Cestius</persName>. They were deceived by him and lighted the pyre accordingly, whereupon he leaped into it. <persName n="31">Aponius</persName> concealed himself securely, but, as he could not endure the meanness of his mode of existence, he came forth and delivered himself to slaughter. Another proscript voluntarily seated himself in full view, and, as the murderers delayed their coming, he strangled himself in public.

27 1 Lucius, the father-in‑law of <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName>, who was then consul, fled by sea, but, as he could not bear the anguish of the tempest he leaped overboard. <persName n="90">Caecina</persName> fled from his pursuers, exclaiming that he was not proscribed, but that they had conspired against him on account of his money. They brought him to the proscription list and told him to read his name on it, and while he was reading killed him. <persName n="5">Aemilius</persName>, not knowing that he was proscribed and seeing another man pursued, asked the pursuing centurion who the proscribed man was. The centurion, recognizing <persName n="5">Aemilius</persName>, replied, "You and he," and killed them both. <persName n="110">Cillo</persName> and <persName n="146">Decius</persName> were going out of the senate-house when they learned that their names had been added to the list of the proscribed, but no one had yet gone in pursuit of them. They fled incontinently through the <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> gates, and their running betrayed them to the centurions whom they met on the road.

<persName n="241">Icelius</persName>, who was one of the judges in the trial of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, when <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was supervising the tribunal with his army, and who, when all the other judges deposited secret ballots of condemnation, alone publicly deposited one of acquittal, now unmindful of his former magnanimity and independence, put his shoulder under a dead body that was being conveyed to burial, and took a place among the carriers of the latter. The guards at the city gates noticed that the number of corpse-bearers was greater by one man than usual, but they did not suspect the bearers. They only searched the bier to make sure that it was not somebody counterfeiting a corpse, but, as the bearers convicted Icelus as not being a member of their trade, he was recognized by the murderers and killed.

28 1 <persName n="590">Varus</persName>, who was betrayed by a freedman, ran away, and after wandering from mountain to mountain came to the marsh at Minturnae, where he stopped to take rest. The inhabitants of Minturnae were scouring this marsh in search of robbers, and the agitation of the reeds revealed the hiding-place of <persName n="590">Varus</persName>. He was captured and said that he was a robber. He was condemned to death on this ground and resigned himself, but as they were preparing to subject him to torture to compel him to reveal his accomplices, he could not bear such an indignity. "I forbid you, citizens of Minturnae," he said, "either to torture or to kill one who has been a consul and — what is more important in the eyes of our present rulers — also proscribed! If it is not permitted me to escape, I prefer to suffer at the hands of my equals." The Minturnians did not believe him. They discredited his story until a centurion, who was scouting in that neighbourhood, recognized him, and cut off his head, leaving the remainder of his body to the Minturnians.

<persName n="256">Largus</persName> was captured in the fields by soldiers who were pursuing another man. They took pity on him because he had been captured when they were not seeking him, and allowed him to escape in the forest. Being pursued by others, he ran back to his first captors, saying, "I would rather that you, who had compassion on me, should kill me, so that you may have the reward instead of those men."

Thus <persName n="256">Largus</persName> recompensed them with his death for their kindness to him. 29 1 As for <persName n="494">Rufus</persName>, he possessed a handsome mansion near that of <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName>, the wife of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, which she had wanted to buy, but he would not sell it, and although he now offered it to her as a free gift, he was proscribed. His head was brought to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who said it did not concern him and sent it to his wife. She ordered that it be fastened to the front of his own house instead of the rostra. Another man had a very handsome and well-shaded country-place in which was a beautiful and deep grotto, on account of which probably he was proscribed. He was taking the air in this grotto when the murderers were observed by a slave, as they were coming toward him, but still some distance off. The slave conveyed him to the innermost recess of the grotto, dressed himself in his master's short tunic, pretended that he was the man and simulated alarm, and would have been killed on the spot had not one of his fellow-slaves exposed the trick. In this way the master was killed, but the people were so indignant that they gave the triumvirs no rest until they had obtained from them the crucifixion of the slave who had betrayed his master, and the freedom of the one who had tried to save him.

A slave revealed the hiding-place of <persName n="227">Haterius</persName> and obtained his freedom in consequence. He bid against the sons at the sale of the dead man's property, and insulted them grossly. They followed him everywhere with silent tears till the people became exasperated, and the triumvirs made him again the slave of the sons of the proscript, for overdoing his part.

30 1 Such were the miseries of grown men, but the calamity extended to orphan children on account of their wealth. One of these, who was going to school, was killed, together with his attendant, who threw his arms around the boy and would not give him up. <persName n="58">Atilius</persName>, who was just assuming the man's toga, went, as was customary, with a procession of friends to sacrifice in the temples. His name being put on the proscription list unexpectedly, his friends and servants ran away. Left alone, and bereft of his fine escort, he went to his mother. She was afraid to receive him. As he did not consider it safe to ask help from anybody else after his mother had failed him, he fled to a mountain. Hunger drove him down to the plain, where he was captured by a highwayman, accustomed to rob passers-by and set them to work in factories. The delicate boy, unable to endure the toil, escaped to the high roads with his fetters, revealed himself to some passing centurions, and was killed.

31 1 While these events were taking place <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> enjoyed a triumph for his exploits in Spain, and an edict was displayed in the following terms: "May Fortune favour us. Let it be proclaimed to all men and women that they celebrate this day with sacrifices and feasting. Whoever shall fail to do shall be put on the list of the proscribed." <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> led the triumphal procession to the Capitol, accompanied by all the citizens, who showed the external appearance of joy, but were sad at heart. The houses of the proscribed were looted, but there were not many buyers of their lands, since some were ashamed to add to the burden of the unfortunate. Others thought that such property would bring them bad luck, or that it would not be at all safe for them to be seen with gold and silver in their possession, or that, as they were not free from danger with their present holdings, it would be an additional risk to increase them. Only the boldest spirits came forward and purchased at the lowest prices, because they were the only buyers. Thus it came to pass that the triumvirs, who had hoped to realize a sufficient sum for their preparations for the war, were still short by 200,000,000 drachmas.

32 1 The triumvirs addressed the people on this subject and published an edict requiring 1400 of the richest women to make a valuation of their property, and to furnish for the service of the war such portion as triumvirs should require from each. It was provided further that if any should conceal their property or make a false valuation they should be fined, and that rewards should be given to informers, whether free persons or slaves. The women resolved to beseech the women-folk of the triumvirs. With the sister of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and the mother of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> they did not fail, but they were repulsed from the doors of <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName>, the wife of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, whose rudeness they could scarce endure. They then forced their way to the tribunal of the triumvirs in the forum, the people and the guards dividing to let them pass. There, through the mouth of <persName n="237">Hortensia</persName>, whom they had selected to speak, they spoke as follows: "As befitted women of our rank addressing a petition to you, we had recourse to the ladies of your households; but having been treated as did not befit us, at the hands of <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName>, we have been driven by her to the forum. You have already deprived us of our fathers, our sons, our husbands, and our brothers, whom you accused of having wronged you; if you take away our property also, you reduce us to a condition unbecoming our birth, our manners, our sex. If we have done you wrong, as you say our husbands have, proscribe us as you do them. But if we women have not voted any of you public enemies, have not torn down your houses, destroyed your army, or led another one against you; if we have not hindered you in obtaining offices and honours, — why do we share the penalty when we did not share the guilt?

33 1 "Why should we pay taxes when we have no part in the honours, the commands, the state-craft,b for which you contend against each other with such harmful results? 'Because this is a time of war," do you say? When have there not been wars, and when have taxes ever been imposed on women, who are exempted by their sex among all mankind? Our mothers did once rise superior to their sex and made contributions when you were in danger of losing the whole empire and the city itself through the conflict with the Carthaginians. But then they contributed voluntarily, not from their landed property, their fields, their dowries, or their houses, without which life is not possible to free women, but only from their own jewellery, and even these not according to the fixed valuation, not under fear of informers or accusers, not by force and violence, but what they themselves were willing to give. What alarm is there now for the empire or the country? Let war with the Gauls or the Parthians come, and we shall not be inferior to our mothers in zeal for the common safety; but for civil wars may we never contribute, nor ever assist you against each other! We did not contribute to <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> or to <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. Neither <persName n="602">Marius</persName> nor <persName n="111">Cinna</persName> imposed taxes upon us. Nor did <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, who held despotic power in the state, do so, whereas you say that you are re-establishing the commonwealth."

34 1 While <persName n="237">Hortensia</persName> thus spoke the triumvirs were angry that women should dare to hold a public meeting when the men were silent; that they should demand from magistrates the reasons for their acts, and themselves not so much as furnish money while the men were serving in the army. They ordered the lictors to drive them away from the tribunal, which they proceeded to do until cries were raised by the multitude outside, when the lictors desisted and the triumvirs said they would postpone till the next day the consideration of the matter. On the following day they reduced the number of the women, who were to present a valuation of their property, from 1400 to 400, and decreed that all men who possessed more than 100,000 drachmas, both citizens and strangers, freedmen and priests, and men of all nationalities without a single exception, should (under the same dread of penalty and also of informers) lend them at interest a fiftieth part of their property and contribute one year's income to the war expenses.

35 1 Such calamities befell the Romans from the orders of the triumvirs; but even worse ones were visited upon them by the soldiers in disregard of orders. Believing that they alone enabled the triumvirs to do what they were doing with impunity, some of them asked for the confiscated houses, or fields, or villas, or entire property of the proscribed. Others demanded that they should be made the adopted sons of rich men. Other, of their own motion, killed men who had not been proscribed, and plundered the houses of those who were not under accusation, so that the triumvirs were obliged to publish an edict that one of the consuls should put a restraint upon those who were exceeding their orders. The consul did not dare to touch the soldiers lest he should excite their rage against himself, but he seized and crucified certain slaves who were masquerading as soldiers and committing outrages in company with them.

36 1 Such are examples of the extreme misfortunes that befell the proscribed. Instances where some were unexpectedly saved and at a later period raised to positions of honour are more agreeable to me to relate, and will be more useful to my readers, as showing that they should never fall into despair, but that hope will always remain to them. Some, who were able to do so, fled to <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, or to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, or to Africa, where <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> upheld the republican cause. The greater number, however, went to Sicily because of its nearness to Italy, where <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> received them gladly. The latter showed the most admirable and timely zeal in behalf of the unfortunate, sending heralds who invited all to come to him, and offered to those who should save the proscribed, both slaves and free persons, double the rewards that had been offered for killing them. His small boats and merchant ships met those who were escaping by sea, and his war-ships sailed along the shore and made signals to those wandering there and saved such as they found. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> himself met the newcomers and provided them at once with clothing and other necessaries. To those who were worthy he assigned commands in his military and naval forces. When, at a later period, he entered into negotiations with the triumvirs, he would not conclude a treaty without embracing in its terms those who had taken refuge with him. In this way he rendered to his unfortunate country the greatest service, from which he gained a high reputation of his own in addition to that which he had inherited from his father, and not less than that. Others escaped by concealing themselves in various ways, some in the fields or in the tombs, others in the city itself, undergoing cruel anxiety until peace was restored. Remarkable examples were shown of the love of wives for their husbands, of sons for their fathers, and of slaves, quite beyond nature, for their masters. Some of the most remarkable of these I shall now relate.

37 1 Lucus Aemilius Paulus, the brother of <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, made his escape to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> by the connivance of the centurions who respected him as the brother of a triumvir. After the death of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> he went to Miletus, which he refused to leave after peace was restored, although he was invited to return. The mother of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> gave shelter to her brother <persName n="278">Lucius Antonius</persName>, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s uncle, without concealment, and the centurions had respect for her for a long time as the mother of a triumvir. When, later, they attempted to take him by force, she hurried into the forum where <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was seated with his colleagues, and exclaimed, "I denounce myself to you, triumvir, for having received <persName n="278">Lucius Antonius</persName> under my roof and for still keeping him, and I shall keep him till you kill us both together, for it is decreed that those who give shelter shall suffer the same punishment." <persName n="27">Antony</persName> reproached her for being an unreasonable mother, although a good sister, saying that she ought to have prevented <persName n="278">Lucius Antonius</persName> in the first place from voting her son a public enemy instead of seeking to save him now. Nevertheless, he procured from the consul <persName n="378">Plancus</persName> a decree restoring <persName n="278">Lucius Antonius</persName> to citizenship.

38 1 <persName n="341">Marcus Messala</persName>, a young man of distinction, fled to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>. The triumvirs, fearing his high spirit, published the following edict: "Since the relatives of <persName n="341">Marcus Messala</persName> have made it clear to us that he was not in the city when <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was slain, let his name be removed from the list of the proscribed." He would not accept pardon, but, after <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> had fallen in Thrace, although there was a considerable army left, as well as ships and money, and although strong hopes of success still existed, <persName n="341">Marcus Messala</persName> would not accept the command when it was offered to him, but persuaded his associates to yield to overpowering fate and join forces with <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. He became intimate with <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and adhered to him until the latter became the slave of <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName>. Then he heaped reproaches upon him and joined himself to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, who made him consul in place of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> himself when the latter was deposed and again voted a public enemy. After the battle of Actium, where he held a naval command against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> sent him as a general against the revolted Celts and awarded him a triumph for his victory over them.

<persName n="76">Bibulus</persName> was received into favour at the same time with <persName n="341">Marcus Messala</persName>, and was given a naval command by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and often served as an intermediate in the negotiations between <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. He was appointed governor of Syria by <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and died while serving in that capacity.

39 1 <persName n="2">Acilius</persName> fled from the city secretly. His hiding-place was disclosed by a slave to the soldiers, but he prevailed upon them, by the hope of a larger reward, to send some of their number to his wife with a private token that he gave them. When they came she gave them all of her jewellery, saying that she gave it in return for what they had promised, although she did not know whether they would keep their agreement. But her fidelity to her husband was not disappointed, for the soldiers hired a ship for <persName n="2">Acilius</persName> and saw him off to Sicily.

40 1 The wife of <persName n="37">Apuleius</persName> threatened that if he should fly without her, she would give information against him. So he took her with him unwillingly, and he succeeded in avoiding suspicion in his flight by travelling with his wife and his male and female slaves in a public manner. The wife of <persName n="25">Antius</persName> wrapped him up in a clothes-bag and gave the bundle to some porters to carry from the house to the sea-shore, whence he made his escape to Sicily. The wife of <persName n="489">Rheginus</persName> concealed him by night in a sewer, into which the soldiers were not willing to enter in the daytime, on account of the foul odour. The next night she disguised him as a charcoal dealer, and furnished him an ass to drive, carrying coals. She led the way at a short distance, borne in a litter. One of the soldiers at the city gates suspected the litter and searched it. <persName n="489">Rheginus</persName> was alarmed and hastened his steps, and as if he were a passer-by admonished the soldier not to give trouble to women. The latter, who took him for a charcoal dealer, answered him angrily, but suddenly recognizing him (for he had served under him in Syria), said, "Go on your way rejoicing, general, for such I ought still to call you." The wife of <persName n="121">Coponius</persName> purchased his safety from <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, although she had previously been chaste, thus curing one evil with another.

41 1 The son of <persName n="210">Geta</persName> pretended to burn his father's remains in the courtyard of his house, making people believe that he had strangled himself. Then he conveyed him secretly to a newly bought field and left him. There the old man changed his appearance by putting a bandage over one of his eyes. After the return of peace he took off the bandage and found that he had lost the sight of that eye by disuse. <persName n="394">Oppius</persName>, by reason of the infirmities of age, was unwilling to fly, but his son carried him on his shoulder till he had brought him outside the gates. The remainder of the journey as far as Sicily he accomplished partly by leading and partly by carrying him, nobody suspecting his appearance and nobody mocking him. In like manner they say that Aeneas was respected even by his enemies when carrying his father. In admiration of his piety the people in later days elected the young man to the aedileship, and since his property had been confiscated and he could not defray the expenses of the office,3 the artisans performed the work appertaining thereto without pay, and each of the spectators tossed such money as he could afford to give into the orchestra, so that he became a rich man. By the will of <persName n="48">Arrianus</persName> the following inscription was engraved on the father's tomb: "Here lies one who, when proscribed, was concealed by his son, who had not yet been proscribed, but who fled with him, and saved him."

42 1 There were two men named xxxx, father and son. The father held a command under <persName n="27">Antony</persName> at the battle of Actium and was taken prisoner, but not recognized. The son fought on the side of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and held a command under him at the same battle. When <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was classifying the prisoners at Samos the son was sitting with him. The old man was led forward covered with hair, misery, and dirt, and completely metamorphosed by them. When his name was called by the herald in the array of prisoners the son sprang from his seat, and, with difficulty recognizing his father, embraced him with a cry of anguish. Then restraining his lamentation he said to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, "He was your enemy, I was your fellow-soldier. He had earned your punishment, I your reward. I ask you either to spare my father on my account, or to kill me at the same time on his account." There was much emotion on all sides, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> spared <persName n="364">Metellus</persName>, although he had been bitterly hostile to himself and had scorned many offers made to him to desert <persName n="27">Antony</persName>.

43 1 <persName n="235">Hirtius</persName> escaped from the city with his household servants and traversed Italy releasing prisoners, collecting runaways, and ravaging small towns at first and afterward large ones, until he found himself possessed of sufficient force to master Bruttium. When an army was sent against him he crossed the straits with his forces and joined <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>.

When <persName n="486">Restio</persName> fled, thinking that he was alone, he was followed secretly by a slave of his own rearing, who had been very well treated by him formerly, but had lately been branded for bad conduct. While <persName n="486">Restio</persName> was stopping in a marsh the slave came up to him. He was startled at the sight, but the slave said that he did not feel the pain of the brand so much as he remembered the former kindness shown to him. Then he found a resting-place for his master in a cave, and by working procured such sustenance for him as he could. The soldiers in the neighbourhood of the cave had their suspicions aroused concerning <persName n="486">Restio</persName>, and went to it. The slave observed their movements and followed them, and, seeing an old man walking in front of them, he ran up and killed him and cut off his head. The soldiers were astounded. They arrested him for a highwayman, but he said, "I have killed <persName n="486">Restio</persName>, my master, the man who marked me with these scars." The soldiers took the head from him for the sake of the reward, and made haste to the city, to find their mistake. The slave brought his master away and conveyed him by ship to Sicily.

44 1 <persName n="32">Appius Claudius</persName> was resting at his country-place when the soldiers burst in. A slave put on his master's clothes and threw himself on his bed and voluntarily died for his master, who was standing beside him dressed as a slave. When the soldiers made a descent upon the house of <persName n="356">Menenius</persName>, one of his slaves got into his master's litter and procured himself to be carried by his fellow-slaves, and in this way allowed himself to be killed for <persName n="356">Menenius</persName>, who thereby escaped to Sicily. <persName n="598">Vinius</persName> had a freedman named <persName n="408">Philemon</persName>, the owner of a splendid mansion, who concealed him in the inmost recesses thereof, in an iron chest used for holding money or manuscripts, and gave him food in the night-time, until the return of peace. Another freedman, who had the custody of his master's tomb, guarded his master's son, who had been proscribed, in the tomb with his father.

<persName n="310">Lucretius</persName>, who had been wandering about with two faithful slaves and had become destitute of food, set out to find his wife and was carried in a litter, in the guise of a sick man, by the two slaves to the city. One of the bearers broke his leg, so <persName n="310">Lucretius</persName> walked leaning on the other. When they reached the gate where the father of <persName n="310">Lucretius</persName>, who had been proscribed by <persName n="549">Sulla</persName>, had been captured, he saw a cohort of soldiers coming out. Being unnerved by the coincidence, he concealed himself with the slave in a tomb. When some tomb-robbers came there searching for plunder, the slave offered himself to these robbers to be stripped till <persName n="310">Lucretius</persName> could escape to the city gate. There <persName n="310">Lucretius</persName> waited for him, shared his clothing with him, and then went to his wife, by whom he was concealed between the planks of a double roof until his friends got his name erased from the proscription. After the restoration of peace he was raised to the consulship.

45 1 <persName n="518">Sergius</persName> was concealed at the house of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> himself until <persName n="27">Antony</persName> persuaded the consul <persName n="378">Plancus</persName> to procure a decree of amnesty for him. At a later period, when <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had fallen into disagreement, and when the Senate was voting <persName n="27">Antony</persName> a public enemy, <persName n="518">Sergius</persName> alone cast his vote openly in the negative.

Thus these all were saved. As for <persName n="425">Pomponius</persName>, he arrayed himself in the garb of a praetor and disguised his slaves as his official attendants. He passed through the city as a praetor attended by lictors, his attendants pressing close to him lest he should be recognized. At the city gates he took possession of public carriages and traversed Italy in the character of a praetor sent by the triumvirs to conduct negotiations with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, all the people receiving him and sending him on as such, until he entered into a public ship and passed over to <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>.

46 1 <persName n="548">Apuleius</persName> and <persName n="49">Arruntius</persName> assumed the character of centurions, armed their slaves as soldiers, and passed through the gates pretending to be in pursuit of other persons, while for the remainder of their course they took different roads, releasing prisoners and collecting fugitives until a sufficient force was obtained by each to display the standards, the equipment, and the appearance of an army. When they each arrived separately at the sea-shore they took position on either side of a certain hill and contemplated each other with great apprehension. At daybreak the next morning, after reconnoitring each other from the hillside, each army took the other for an army sent against itself, and they actually came to blows and fought until they discovered their error, when they dropped their arms and broke into lamentations, blaming the hard fate that pursued them everywhere. Then they took ship, and one of them sailed to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and the other to <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. The latter was included in the reconciliation with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. The former took command of Bithynia for <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, and when <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> fell he surrendered Bithynia to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and was restored to citizenship. When <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName> was proscribed one of his freedmen put fetters on him as though intending to deliver him to the murderers. But at night he gave instructions to some slaves, whom he armed as soldiers, and then he led his master forth in the character of a centurion, and they traversed the whole of Italy as far as Sicily, and often passed the night in company with other centurions who were in search of <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName>.

47 1 Another proscript was concealed by a freedman in a tomb, but as he could not endure the horror of the place he was transferred to a miserable hired hovel. A soldier was lodged near him, and as he could not endure this fear he changed from a feeling of cowardice to the most wonderful audacity. He cut off his hair and opened a school in Rome itself, which he taught until the return of peace. <persName n="600">Volusius</persName> was proscribed while holding the office of aedile. He had a friend who was a priest of Isis, whose robe he begged. He clothed himself with this linen garment reaching to his feet, put on the dog's head and thus as a priest of Isis he made the journey to <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. The inhabitants of Cales protected <persName n="540">Sittius</persName>, one of their citizens who had made lavish expenditures from his own fortune for their benefit, and provided an armed guard for him. They silenced his slaves by threats and prevented the soldiers from approaching their walls until the troubles began to subside, when they sent envoys to the triumvirs on his behalf and obtained permission for <persName n="540">Sittius</persName> that he might remain at home, but should be excluded from the rest of Italy. <persName n="540">Sittius</persName> was the first or the only man who was ever an exile in his own country. <persName n="556">Varro</persName> was a philosopher and a historian, a soldier and a distinguished general, and for these reasons perhaps was proscribed as hostile to the monarchy. His friends were eager to give him shelter and contended with each other for the honour of doing so. <persName n="92">Calenus</persName> won the privilege and took him to his country house, where <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was accustomed to stop when travelling. Yet no slave, either of <persName n="92">Calenus</persName> or of <persName n="556">Varro</persName> himself, revealed the fact that <persName n="556">Varro</persName> was there.

48 1 <persName n="599">Virginius</persName>, an orator of distinction, told his slaves that if they should kill him for a small and uncertain reward they would be filled with remorse and terror afterward, while if they should save him they would enjoy an excellent reputation and good hopes, and, later, a much larger and more certain reward. So they fled, taking him with them in the guise of a fellow-slave, and when he was recognized on the road they fought against the soldiers. Being captured by the latter, he told them that they had no reason for killing him except for the money, and that they would get a more honourable and larger reward by going with him to the sea-shore, "where," said he, "my wife has arranged to bring a ship with money." They followed his suggestion and went with him to the sea-shore. His wife had come to the rendezvous according to agreement, but as <persName n="599">Virginius</persName> had been delayed, she thought that he had already sailed to <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. So she had embarked, leaving a slave at the rendezvous, however, to tell him if he should come. When the slave saw <persName n="599">Virginius</persName> he ran up as though to his master, and pointed out to him the ship which had just started, and told him about his wife and the money and why he (the slave) had been left behind. The soldiers now believed all that they heard, and when <persName n="599">Virginius</persName> asked them to wait till his wife could be called back, or to go with him after her to obtain the money, they embarked in a small boat and conveyed him to Sicily, rowing with all their might. There they received what had been promised them, and they did not go back, but remained in his service until peace was declared.

A ship captain received <persName n="485">Rebilus</persName> in his vessel in order to convey him to Sicily and then demanded money, threatening to betray him if he did not get it. <persName n="485">Rebilus</persName> followed the example of Themistocles when he fled. He threatened in turn that he would tell how the captain was helping him to escape for money. The captain was afraid, and he carried <persName n="485">Rebilus</persName> over to <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>.

49 1 <persName n="347">Marcus</persName> was one of the lieutenants of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and was proscribed for that reason. When <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> was defeated he was captured. He pretended to be a slave and was bought by <persName n="72">Barbula</persName>. The latter, perceiving that he was skilful, placed him over his fellow-slaves and gave him charge of his private disbursements. As he was clever in all respects and superior in intelligence to the condition of a slave, his master had suspicions and encouraged him to hope that if he would confess that he was one of the proscribed he (<persName n="72">Barbula</persName>) would procure his pardon. He denied stoutly, and gave himself a feigned name and family and former masters. <persName n="72">Barbula</persName> brought him to Rome, expecting that if he were proscribed he would show reluctance to come, but he followed all the same. One of <persName n="72">Barbula</persName>'s friends, who met him at the gates, saw <persName n="347">Marcus</persName> standing by his side in the character of a slave, and privately told <persName n="72">Barbula</persName> who he was, and he obtained from <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, through the intercession of <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName>, the erasure of the name of <persName n="347">Marcus</persName> from the proscription. The latter became a friend of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and some time later served as his lieutenant against <persName n="27">Antony</persName> at the battle of Actium. <persName n="72">Barbula</persName> was then serving with <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and the fortune of both of them was reversed. For when <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was vanquished <persName n="72">Barbula</persName> was taken prisoner and he pretended to be a slave, and <persName n="347">Marcus</persName> bought him pretending not to know him. Then he laid the whole matter before <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and asked that he might compensate <persName n="72">Barbula</persName> with a like service, and his request was granted.

This similarity of good fortune attended these two in after times, for they both held the chief magistracy in the city the same year. 50 1 <persName n="69">Balbinus</persName> took refuge with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> and was restored with him, and became consul not long afterward. <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, who had meanwhile been deposed from the triumvirate by <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and reduced to private life, presented himself to <persName n="69">Balbinus</persName> under the following stress. <persName n="313">Maecenas</persName> prosecuted the son of <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> for high treason against <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and also the young man's mother as knowing of the crime. <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> himself he overlooked as being a person of no consequence. <persName n="313">Maecenas</persName> sent the son to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> at Actium, but in order to spare his mother the journey on account of her sex, he demanded that she should give bail to the consul for her appearance before <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. As nobody offered bail for her, <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> presented himself frequently at the door of <persName n="69">Balbinus</persName> and also at his tribunal, and though the attendants long forced him away, he made himself heard with difficulty to this effect: "The accusers testify to my innocence, since they say that I was not an accomplice of my wife and son. I did not cause you to be proscribed, yet I am now inferior to the proscribed. Consider the mutability of human affairs and grant to one, who stands by your side, the favour of becoming security for my wife's appearance before <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, or let me go there with her." When <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> had thus spoken, <persName n="69">Balbinus</persName> took pity on his reverse of fortune, and released his wife from bail altogether.

51 1 <persName n="329">Marcus Cicero</persName>, the son of <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, had been sent away to Greece by his father, who anticipated these evils. From Greece he proceeded to join <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, and after the latter's death he joined <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, by both of whom he was honoured with a military command. Afterwards <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, by way of apology for his betrayal of <persName n="607">Cicero</persName>, caused him to be appointed pontifex, and not long afterwards consul and then proconsul of Syria. When the news of the overthrow of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> at Actium was forwarded by <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> this same <persName n="329">Marcus Cicero</persName>, as consul, announced it to the people and affixed it to the rostra where formerly his father's head had been exhibited. <persName n="32">Appius Claudius</persName> distributed his goods among his slaves and then sailed with them to Sicily. Being overtaken by a storm, the slaves formed a plot to get possession of his money, and placed <persName n="32">Appius Claudius</persName> in a small boat, pretending to transfer him to a safer place; but it turned out that he reached the port most unexpectedly, while their ship was wrecked and they all perished. <persName n="443">Publius</persName>, quaestor of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, was solicited by the party of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> to betray his chief, but refused, and was for that reason proscribed. Afterward he was restored to citizenship and became a friend of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. Once when <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> came to visit him <persName n="443">Publius</persName> displayed some images of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> praised him for doing so.

The above are some of the most remarkable cases where the proscribed were lost or saved. Many others I have omitted. 52 1 In the meantime, while these transactions were taking place at Rome, all the outlying countries were torn by hostilities growing out of the same commotion. Chief among these wars was that in Africa between <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> and <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName>, that in Syria between <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, and that against <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> around Sicily. Many cities suffered the calamity of capture. I shall pass by the smaller ones and confine myself to the largest, and especially the very celebrated captures of Laodicea, Tarsus, Rhodes, Patara, and Xanthus. I shall relate briefly what took place at each of these. return to this place

53 1 That part of Africa which the Romans took from the Carthaginians they still call Old Africa. The part that belonged to King <persName n="242">Juba</persName>, and which was taken by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> at a later period, they call for that reason New Africa; it might also be called Numidian Africa. Accordingly <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName>, who held the government of New Africa, being appointed by <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, summoned <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> to abandon Old Africa to him because the whole country had been assigned to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> in the allotment of the triumvirs. <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> replied that he did not know what allotment the triumvirs had made among themselves, and that since he had received the government from the Senate he would not surrender it to anybody else without the order of the Senate. This was the origin of hostilities between them. <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> had the heavier and more numerous army. That of <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName> was more nimble though inferior in number, by which means he was enabled to dash round and detach from <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> his inland districts until he was besieged by <persName n="592">Ventidius</persName>, a lieutenant of <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName>, who brought against him superior forces and whom he resisted valiantly. <persName n="254">Laelius</persName>, another lieutenant of <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName>, ravaged the province of <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName>, sat down before the city of Cirta, and laid siege to it.

54 1 Both parties sent ambassadors to secure the alliance of King <persName n="39">Arabio</persName> and of the so‑called Sittians, who received their name from the following circumstance. A certain <persName n="539">Sittius</persName>, who was under accusation at Rome, took flight in order to avoid trial. Collecting an army from Italy and Spain, he crossed over to Africa, where he allied himself now with one and now with another of the warring kings of that country. As those with whom he joined himself were always victorious, <persName n="539">Sittius</persName> acquired a reputation and his army became wonderfully efficient. When <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> pursued the Pompeians to Africa <persName n="539">Sittius</persName> joined him and destroyed <persName n="242">Juba</persName>'s famous general, <persName n="497">Saburra</persName>, and received from <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, as a reward for these services, the territory of Masinissa, not all, but the best part of it. Masinissa was the father of this <persName n="39">Arabio</persName> and the ally of <persName n="242">Juba</persName>. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> gave his territory to this <persName n="539">Sittius</persName>, and to <persName n="733">Bocchus</persName>, the king of Mauritania, and <persName n="539">Sittius</persName> divided his own portion among his soldiers. <persName n="39">Arabio</persName> at that time fled to the sons of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> in Spain, but returned to Africa after <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s death and kept sending to the younger <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> detachments of his men, whom he received back in a state of good training, and so expelled <persName n="733">Bocchus</persName> from his territory and killed <persName n="539">Sittius</persName> by stratagem. Although for these reasons he was friendly toward the Pompeians, he nevertheless decided against that party, because it was so extremely unlucky, and joined <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName>, through whom he acquired the favour of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. The Sittians also joined him by reason of their friendship for the elder <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>.

55 1 Thus encouraged <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName> made a sortie by which <persName n="592">Ventidius</persName> was killed and his army put to headlong flight. <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName> pursued them, killing and taking prisoners. When <persName n="254">Laelius</persName> heard the news he raised the siege of Cirta and joined <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName>. <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName>, elated by his success, advanced against <persName n="125">Cornificus</persName> himself at Utica and encamped opposite him, although the latter had the superior force. <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> sent <persName n="254">Laelius</persName> with his cavalry to make a reconnaissance, and <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName> ordered <persName n="39">Arabio</persName> to engage him with his own cavalry in front, and <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName> himself with his light troops fell upon the enemy's flank and threw them into such confusion that <persName n="254">Laelius</persName>, although not vanquished, feared lest his retreat should be cut off and took possession of a hill near by. <persName n="39">Arabio</persName> hung upon his rear, killed many, and surrounded the hill. When <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> saw this he sallied out with the greater part of his force to assist <persName n="254">Laelius</persName>. <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName>, who was in his rear, dashed up and attacked him, but <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> turned upon him and drove him back, although suffering severely.

56 1 Meanwhile <persName n="39">Arabio</persName>, with a band of men accustomed to climbing rocks, scaled a precipice to the camp of <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> and stole into it unobserved. When the camp was captured <persName n="490">Roscius</persName>, the custodian, offered his throat to one of his assistants and was killed. <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName>, overcome by the fatigue of the engagement, retired toward <persName n="254">Laelius</persName> on the hill, not yet knowing what had happened to his camp. While he was retreating the cavalry of <persName n="39">Arabio</persName> charged upon him and killed him, and when <persName n="254">Laelius</persName>, looking down from the hill, saw what had happened he killed himself. When the leaders had fallen the soldiers fled in various directions. Of the proscribed who were with <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName>, some crossed over to Sicily, others took refuge wherever they could. <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName> gave great spoils to <persName n="39">Arabio</persName> and the Sittians, but the cities he brought into allegiance to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and granted pardon to them all.

This was the end of the war in Africa between <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName> and <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName>, which seemed inconsiderable by reason of the rapidity with which it was prosecuted. 57 1 Resuming the narrative of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, I shall repeat some small part of what has already been said, in order to refresh the memory. When <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was assassinated his murderers took possession of the Capitol, and when amnesty was voted to them they came down. The people were greatly moved at <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s funeral and scoured the city in pursuit of his murderers. The latter defended themselves from the roofs of their houses, and those of them who had been appointed by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> himself as governors of provinces departed from the city forthwith. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, however, and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> were still city praetors, though <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> had been chosen by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> as governor of Syria and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> of Macedonia. As they could not enter at once upon these offices, and as they were afraid to remain in the city, they took their departure while still praetors, and the Senate, for the sake of appearances, gave them charge of the supply of corn, so that they might not seem to have taken flight in the interval. After they had gone, the provinces of Syria and Macedonia were transferred to the consuls <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> much against the will of the Senate. Nevertheless, Cyrene and Crete were given to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> in exchange. These provinces they despised because of their insignificance, and, accordingly, they set about raising troops and money in order to invade Syria and Macedonia.

58 1 While they were thus engaged <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> put <persName n="579">Trebonius</persName> to death in Asia and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> besieged <persName n="144">Decimus Brutus</persName> in Cisalpine Gaul. The Senate in indignation voted both <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> public enemies, and restored both <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> to the former commands and added Illyria to that of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>. It also ordered all other persons holding commands of Roman provinces or armies, between the Adriatic and Syria, to obey the orders of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>. Thereupon <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> anticipated <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> by entering Syria, where he raised the standards of a governor and won over twelve legions of soldiers who had been enlisted and trained by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> long before. One of these <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had left in Syria when he was contemplating a war against the Parthians, and had placed it under the charge of <persName n="85">Caecilius Bassus</persName>, but had given the nominal command to <persName n="534">Sextus Caesar</persName>, a young man who was his kinsman. This <persName n="534">Sextus Caesar</persName> was a fellow of loose habits who led the legion into shameful dissipations and once insulted <persName n="85">Caecilius Bassus</persName> when the latter remonstrated with him. Afterward he summoned <persName n="85">Caecilius Bassus</persName> to his presence, and when the latter delayed he ordered that he be dragged before him. There was a disgraceful tumult in consequence, and some blows were given to <persName n="85">Caecilius Bassus</persName>, the sight of which the army resented, and <persName n="534">Sextus Caesar</persName> was shot down. This act was followed straightway by repentance and fear of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and so they bound each other by an oath that, unless they were granted pardon and reconciliation, they would fight to the death; and they compelled <persName n="85">Caecilius Bassus</persName> to take the same oath. They recruited another legion and both were drilled together. <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> sent <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> against them with three legions, but they resisted bravely, <persName n="320">Marcius Crispus</persName> was then sent from Bithynia to the aid of <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> with three additional legions, and thus <persName n="85">Caecilius Bassus</persName> was besieged by six legions altogether.

59 1 <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> speedily intervened in this siege and took command at once of the army of <persName n="85">Caecilius Bassus</persName> with its consent, and afterward of the legions of <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> and <persName n="320">Marcius Crispus</persName>, who surrendered them to him in a friendly way and in pursuance of the decree of the Senate obeyed him in all respects. About the same time <persName n="15">Allienus</persName>, who had been sent to Egypt by <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, brought from that country four legions composed of men who had been dispersed after the disasters of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> and <persName n="133">Crassus</persName>, or who had been left with <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName> by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> surrounded him in Palestine unexpectedly, while he was in ignorance of what had happened, and compelled him to come to terms and surrender his army, as he did not dare to fight with four legions against eight. Thus in a marvellous manner <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> came into possession of twelve first-rate legions, to whom were added a certain number of Parthian mounted bowmen, who were attracted by the reputation he had acquired among them from the time when, as quaestor to <persName n="133">Crassus</persName>, he had shown himself to be more skilful than that general.

60 1 <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> was spending his time in Ionia, where he put <persName n="579">Trebonius</persName> to death, levied tribute on the towns, and hired a naval force, by means of <persName n="165">Figulus</persName>, from the Rhodians, Lycians, Pamphylians, and Cilicians. When all was in readiness he advanced toward Syria, leading two legions by land himself, while <persName n="165">Figulus</persName> proceeded by sea. After he had learned of the forces of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> he passed on to Laodicea, a city friendly to himself, situated on a peninsula, fortified on the landward side and having a roadstead in the sea, so that supplies might be easily obtained by water and he might sail away securely whenever he wished. When <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> learned this, fearing lest <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> should escape him, he threw up a mound across the isthmus, two stades in length, composed of stones and all sorts of material brought together from suburban houses and tombs, and at the same time sent to Phoenicia, Lycia, and Rhodes for ships.

61 1 Being ignored by all except the Sidonians, he came to a naval engagement with <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, in which a number of ships were sunk on both sides and <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> captured five with their crews. Then <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> again sent to those who had rejected his application, and also to <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName>, queen of Egypt and to <persName n="517">Serapio</persName>, her viceroy in Cyprus. The Tyrians, the Aradii, and <persName n="517">Serapio</persName>, not waiting to consult <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName>, sent <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> what ships they had. The queen excused herself on the ground that Egypt was at that time suffering from famine and pestilence, but she was really co-operating with <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> on account of her relations with the elder <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. This was the reason why she had sent him the four legions by <persName n="15">Allienus</persName>, and had another fleet ready to assist him, which was kept back by adverse winds. The Rhodians and the Lycians said that they would help neither <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> nor <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> in civil wars, and that when they supplied ships to <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> they furnished them as an escort, not knowing that they were to be used as allies in war.

62 1 When <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> had again made such preparations as he could with the forces in hand he engaged <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> a second time. The first battle was doubtful, but in the next one <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> was beaten on the sea. Then <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> completed his mound and battered <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>'s walls till they trembled. He tried unsuccessfully to bribe <persName n="349">Marsus</persName>, the captain of the night-watch, but he bribed the centurions of the day force, and while <persName n="349">Marsus</persName> was taking his rest, effected an entrance by daylight through a number of small gates that were secretly opened to him one after another. When the city was taken <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> offered his head to his private sentry and told him to cut it off and carry it to <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> in order to secure his own safety. The guard cut if off, but he killed himself also and <persName n="349">Marsus</persName> took his own life. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> swore <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>'s army into his own service. He plundered the temples and the treasury of Laodicea, punished the chief citizens, and exacted very heavy contributions from the rest, so that the city was reduced to the extremest misery.

63 1 After the capture of Laodicea <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> turned his attention to Egypt. Having learned that <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName> was about to join <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> with a strong fleet, he proposed to prevent its sailing and to punish the queen for her intention. He had before this thought that the condition of Egypt was especially favourable for these designs, because it was wasted by famine and had no considerable foreign army, now that the forces of <persName n="15">Allienus</persName> had taken their departure. In the midst of his eagerness, his hopes, and his opportunity came a hasty summons from <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> telling him that <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> were crossing the Adriatic. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> reluctantly gave up his hopes in respect of Egypt. He also sent back his Parthian mounted bowmen with presents, and with them ambassadors to their king asking for a larger force of auxiliaries. This force arrived after the decisive battle, ravaged Syria and many of the neighbouring provinces as far as Ionia, and then returned home. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> left his nephew in Syria with one legion and sent his cavalry in advance into Cappadocia, who presently killed <persName n="45">Ariobarzanes I</persName> for plotting against <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>. Then they seized his large treasures and other military supplies and brought them to <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>.

64 1 The people of Tarsus were divided into factions. One of these factions had crowned <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, who was the first to arrive. The other had done the same for <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, who came later. Both had acted thus in the name of the city. As the inhabitants bestowed their honours upon each alternately, each of them treated it despitefully as a fickle-minded place. After <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> had overcome <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> he levied a contribution on it of 1500 talents. Being unable to find the money, and being pressed for payment with violence by the soldiers, the people sold all their public property and after that they coined all the sacred articles used in religious processions and the temple offerings into money. As this was not sufficient, the magistrates sold free persons into bondage, first girls and boys, afterward women and miserable old men, who brought a very small price, and finally young men. Most of these committed suicide. Finally <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, on his return from Syria, took pity on their sufferings and released them from the remainder of the contribution. Such were the calamities that befell Tarsus and Laodicea.

65 1 When <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> had their conference, <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> was in favour of uniting their armies and making Macedonia their chief concern, since the enemy had forty legions, of which eight had already crossed the Adriatic. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> was of the opinion that the enemy might still be disregarded, believing that they would waste away of themselves for want of supplies by reason of their great numbers. He thought it would be best to reduce the Rhodians and Lycians, who were friendly to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who had fleets, lest they should fall on the rear of the republicans while the latter were busy with the enemy. Having decided to do this, they separated, <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> proceeding against Lycians and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> against Rhodes, in which place he was brought up, and educated in the literature of Greece. As he had to contend with men of superior naval prowess, he prepared his own ships with care, filled them with troops, and drilled them at Myndus.

66 1 The Rhodians of distinction were alarmed at the prospect of a conflict with Romans, but the common people were in high spirits, because they recalled former victories achieved over men of different character.4 They launched thirty-three of their best ships, but while doing so they nevertheless sent messengers to Myndus to urge <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> not to despise Rhodes, which had always defended herself against those who underestimated her, and not to disregard the treaty which existed between the Rhodians and the Romans which bound them not to bear arms against each other. If he complained of them for not rendering military assistance, they would be glad to hear from the Roman Senate, and if called upon they would lend such assistance.

When they had spoken thus <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> replied that as to the other matters war would decide instead of words, but as regarded the treaty, which forbade them to bear arms against each other, the Rhodians had violated it by allying themselves with <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> against <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>. The treaty required them to assist each other in war, but when <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> asked for assistance they quibbled about the Roman Senate, which was either in flight or held captive at present by the tyrants who had mastered the city. Those tyrants will be punished, and the Rhodians would be punished also for siding with them, unless they speedily obeyed his commands. Such was the answer <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> returned to them. The more prudent Rhodians were still more alarmed, but the multitude were excited by two public speakers named <persName n="14">Alexander</persName> and <persName n="374">Mnaseas</persName>, who reminded them that <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName> had invaded Rhodes with a still larger fleet, and that Demetrius had done so before him.

Thereupon they elected <persName n="14">Alexander</persName> as president, who is the magistrate exercising the supreme power among them, and <persName n="374">Mnaseas</persName> as admiral of their fleet. 67 1 Nevertheless, they sent still another ambassador to <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> in the person of <persName n="42">Archelaus</persName>, who had been his teacher in Greek literature in Rhodes, to present a more earnest petition. This he did, taking <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> by the right hand in a familiar manner, and saying, "O friend of the Greeks, do not destroy a Greek city. O friend of freedom, do not destroy Rhodes. Do not put to shame the glory of a Doric state hitherto unvanquished. Do not forget the famous histories you learned both at Rhodes and at Rome — at Rhodes, what the Rhodians accomplished against states and kings (and especially against <persName n="149">Demetrius</persName> and <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName>, who were deemed invincible), in behalf of that freedom for which you say that you also are now contending — at Rome, our services to you, among others those that were rendered when we fought with you against <persName n="23">Antiochus the Great</persName>, concerning which you have monuments inscribed in our honour.

"So much, Romans, for our race, our dignity, our condition hitherto unenslaved, our alliance, and our good-will toward you. 68 1 As for you, <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, you owe a peculiar reverence to this city in which you were brought up and educated, lived, and had your homes, and where you attended my very school. You owe respect to me who hoped that I should some time plume myself on your education with different expectations, but I am now pleading this relation in behalf of my country, lest it be forced into a war with you, its pupil and its ward, where one of two things must necessity happen: either that the Rhodians perish utterly, or that you, <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, be defeated. In addition to my entreaty I give you the advice that while engaged in such important tasks in behalf of the Roman commonwealth you take the gods for your leaders at every step. You, Romans, swore by the gods when you recently concluded the treaty with us through <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and to the oaths you added libations and gave the right hand, assurances valid even among enemies; shall they not be valid among friends and guardians? Besides dreading the judgment of the gods, have regard for the opinions of mankind, who consider nothing more base than a violation of treaties, which causes the violators to be distrusted in all respects by both friends and enemies."

69 1 When the old man had thus spoken he did not let go <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>' hand, but shed tears on it, so that <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> blushed at the spectacle and was moved somewhat by the sense of shame, yet he drew away his hand, and said, "If you have not counselled the Rhodians not to wrong me, you have yourself done me wrong. If you have so counselled them and they have not followed your advice I will avenge you. That I have suffered injury is plain enough. The first wrong done me was when I asked assistance and was slighted by my instructors and guardians. In the next place they gave the preference to <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, whom they had not brought up and educated, rather than to me. And what makes it worse, O freedom-loving Rhodians, is that <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and I and the noblest men of the Senate, whom you see here, were fugitives from tyranny for endeavouring to liberate their country, while <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> was seeking to enslave it to others, whom you also favour while pretending to abstain from our civil wars. This would be a civil war if we also were aiming at supreme power, but it is plainly a war of the republic against monarchy. And you, who appeal to me in behalf of your own freedom, have refused aid to the republic. While professing friendship for the Romans you have no pity for those who are sentenced to death and confiscation without trial. You pretend that you want to hear from the Senate, which is suffering from these evils and is not yet able to defend itself. But the Senate had answered you beforehand when it decreed that all the peoples of the Orient should lend aid to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and myself.

70 1 "Whatever aid you have rendered us when we were adding to our possessions (for which you reaped abundant benefactions and rewards) you remind us of, but that in our time of adversity you fail us in the struggle for freedom and safety, you lose sight of. Even if we had had no relations with each other before, you ought, as members of the Doric race, now at least begin to fight as volunteers for the Roman republic. Instead of such thoughts and deeds you quote to us treaties — treaties made with you by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, the founder of the present monarchy — yet these very treaties say that the Romans and the Rhodians shall assist each other in case of need. Therefore, assist the Romans in the time of their greatest peril! It is <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> who quotes these very treaties to you and calls for your help in war — <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, a Roman citizen and a Roman general, whom, as the Senate's decree says, all the countries beyond the Adriatic are required to obey. The same decrees are presented to you by <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, and also by <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, who has been invested by the Senate with the command of the sea. Added to these decrees are the prayers of all these senators who have fled, some to myself and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, and others to Sextus Pmopey. The treaty provides that the Rhodians shall lend aid to the Romans even in cases where the application is made by single individuals. If you do not consider us as generals or even as Romans, but as exiles, or strangers, or persons condemned, as the proscribers call us, O Rhodians, you have no treaties with us, but only with the Roman people. Being strangers and foreigners to treaties, we will fight you unless you obey our orders in everything.

With this ironical remark <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> sent <persName n="42">Archelaus</persName> away. 71 1 Meanwhile <persName n="14">Alexander</persName> and <persName n="374">Mnaseas</persName>, the Rhodian leaders, put to sea with their thirty-three ships against <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> at Myndus, intending to surprise him by the suddenness of their attack. They built their hopes somewhat lightly on the supposition that it was at Myndus by sailing against <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName> they had brought that war to a successful end. In order to display their seamanship they took their station the first day at Cnidus. The next day they showed themselves to the forces of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> on the high sea. The latter in astonishment put to sea against them, and it was a battle of strength and capacity on both sides. The Rhodians with their light ships darted swiftly through the enemy's line, turned around, and attacked them in the rear. The Romans had heavier ships, and whenever they could come to close quarters they prevailed, as in an engagement on land, by their greater momentum. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, by reason of his more numerous fleet, was enabled to surround his enemy, and then the latter could no longer turn and dart through his line. When they could only attack in front and then haul off, their nautical skill was of no avail in the narrow space where they had been confined. The ramming with their prows and broadside movements5 against the heavier Roman ships did little damage, while those of the Romans against the lighter vessels were more effective. Finally, three Rhodian ships were captured with their crews, two were rammed and sunk, and the remainder took flight to Rhodes in a damaged condition. All of the Roman ships returned to Myndus, where they were repaired, the greater part of them also having suffered injury.

72 1 Such was the result of the naval engagement of the Romans and the Rhodians at Myndus. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> watched the fight while it was going on from a mountain. When he had repaired his ships he sailed to Loryma, a fortified place belonging to the Rhodians on the mainland opposite the island, from which he sent his foot-soldiers across in transports under the command of <persName n="161">Fannius</persName> and <persName n="262">Lentulus</persName>. He advanced in person with eighty ships rigged in a way to produce terror. He surrounded Rhodes with his land and naval forces, and then remained quiet, expecting that the enemy would show signs of weakening. But they sailed out again valiantly and, after losing two more ships, were hemmed in on all sides. Then they mounted the walls, heaped them with missiles, and resisted simultaneously the soldiers of <persName n="161">Fannius</persName>, who were assailing them on the landward side, and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, who was advancing his naval force, prepared for wall-fighting, against the defences on the sea. Anticipating such a necessity he had brought with him turrets in sections, which were then elevated. Thus was Rhodes, after suffering two naval defeats, beleaguered by land and sea, and, as frequently happens in sudden and unexpected trouble, found herself wholly unprepared for siege; whence it became evident that the city must speedily be taken either by assault or by famine. The more intelligent of the Rhodians perceived this and opened communications with <persName n="161">Fannius</persName> and <persName n="262">Lentulus</persName>.

73 1 While this was going on <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> suddenly made his appearance in the midst of the city with a chosen band of soldiers, without any show of violence or use of ladders. Most people conjectured, as seems the fact, that those of the citizens who were favourable to him had opened the small gates, being moved by pity for the town and the apprehension of famine.

Thus was Rhodes captured; and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> took his seat on the tribunal and planted a spear by the side of it to indicate that he had taken the city by the spear. Laying strict commands upon his soldiers to remain quiet, and threatening with death any who should resort to violence or plunder, he summoned by name about fifty citizens, and when they were brought, put them to death. Others, who were not found, numbering about twenty-five, he ordered to be banished. All the money that was found, either gold or silver, in the temples and the public treasury, he seized, and he ordered private citizens who had any to bring it to him on a day named, proclaiming death to those who should conceal it, together with a reward of one-tenth to informers and freedom in addition to in the case of slaves. At first many concealed what they had, hoping that in the end the threat would not be carried out, but when they saw the rewards paid and those who had been informed against punished, they became alarmed, and having procured the appointment of another day, some of them dug their money out of the ground, others drew it out of wells, and others brought it from tombs, in much larger amounts than the former collections.

74 1 Such were the calamities that befell the Rhodians. <persName n="309">Lucius Varus</persName> was left in charge of them with a garrison. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, although delighted with the quickness of the capture and the quantity of money taken, nevertheless ordered all the other peoples of Asia to pay ten years' tribute, and this they did within a short space of time. News now reached him that <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName> was about to sail with a large fleet, heavily provisioned, to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. She had espoused their cause previously on account of her relations with the first <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and now she espoused it all the more by reason of her fear of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>. The latter sent <persName n="379">Murcus</persName>, with a legion of the best soldiers and a certain number of archers, with sixty decked ships, to the Peloponnesus, to lie in wait in the neighbourhood of Taenarum; [and this he did] collecting as much booty as he could come upon from the Peloponnese.

75 1 We will now relate the transactions of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> in Lycia, first glancing at what has been mentioned above in order to refresh the memory. When he had received from <persName n="548">Apuleius</persName> certain soldiers which the latter had under his command, together with 16,000 talents in money which <persName n="548">Apuleius</persName> had collected from the tribute of Asia, he passed into Boeotia. The Senate having voted that he should use this money for his present necessities and that he should have command of Macedonia, and of Illyria in addition, he came into possession of the three legions of the army which were in Illyria, which <persName n="591">Vatinius</persName>, the former governor of Illyria, delivered to him. Another one he captured from <persName n="178">Gaius, the brother</persName> of <persName n="27">Mark Antony</persName>, in Macedonia. He collected four more in addition to these, so that he had eight legions in all, most of whom had served under <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. He had a large force of cavalry, light-armed troops, and archers. He had a high opinion of his Macedonian soldiers and he drilled them in the Roman way. While he was still collecting soldiers and money a piece of good luck came to him from Thrace, of the following sort. <persName n="419">Polemocratia</persName>, the wife of one of the Thracian princes, being alarmed for her son, who was still a boy, came to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> bringing the boy, whom she placed in his hands together with her husband's treasures. <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> delivered the boy to the inhabitants of Cyzicus to be cared for until he should have leisure to restore him to his kingdom. Among the treasures he found an unexpected quantity of gold and silver.

This he coined and converted into currency. 76 1 When <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> came, and it was decided to begin by reducing the Lycians and Rhodians, <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> turned his attention first to the inhabitants of Xanthus in Lycia. The latter destroyed their suburbs in order that <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> might not effect a lodgment or find material there. They also surrounded the city with a trench and embankment of more than fifty feet vertically and of corresponding breadth, from which they fought, so that standing upon it they could hurl darts and shoot arrows as though protected by an impassable river. <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> invested the place, pushed forward mantlets for his men, divided his army into day and night forces, brought up material from long distances, hurrying and cheering them on as if for prizes, and spared neither zeal nor labour. So the work which it seemed most likely could not be done at all in the face of an opposing enemy, or only at the end of many months, was accomplished by him in a few days, and the Xanthians were now subjected to close siege.

77 1 <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> attacked them now with battering-rams against the walls, now by assaults upon the gates with foot-soldiers, whom he kept changing continually. The defenders being always pitted against fresh soldiers although fatigued, and all wounded, nevertheless held out as long as their parapets remained. When these were battered down and the towers broken through, <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, foreseeing what would happen, ordered those who were attacking the gates to withdraw. The Xanthians, thinking that the enemy's works were deserted and unguarded, darted out by night with torches to set fire to the machines. Suddenly the Romans attacked them as ordered, and they again fled to the gates, the guards of which closed them before they entered, fearing lest the enemy should rush in with them — and so there was round the gates a great slaughter of the Xanthians who were shut out.

78 1 Soon afterwards the remainder made a fresh sally about midday, and as the besiegers withdrew again, they set fire to all the machines. As the gates were left open for them on account of the former calamity, about 2000 Romans broke in with them. While others were pushing in at the entrance the portcullis suddenly fell upon them, either by the design of the Xanthians or the accidental breaking of the ropes, so that some of the Romans who were forcing their way in were crushed and the others found their retreat cut off, as they could not raise the portcullis without hoisting apparatus. Pelted by missiles hurled upon them by the Xanthians from the roofs in the narrow streets, they forced their way with difficulty till they came to the forum, which was near by, and there they overcame the forces which were at close quarters with them, but, being under heavy volleys of arrows and having themselves neither bows nor javelins, they took refuge by the temple of Sarpedon to avoid being surrounded. The Romans who were outside the walls were excited and anxious for those inside, and tried every expedient, <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> meantime darting hither and thither, but they were not able to break the portcullis, which was protected with iron, nor could they procure ladders or towers since their own had been burned. Nevertheless some of them made extemporized ladders, and others pushed trunks of trees against the walls and climbed up as if by ladders. Still others fastened iron hooks to ropes and hurled them up to the walls, and whenever one of them caught fast they climbed up.

79 1 The Oenandians, who were neighbours of the Xanthians, and who had formed an alliance with <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> because of their enmity to the latter, clambered up by way of the crags. When the Romans saw them they toiled up after them. Many fell off, but some scaled the wall and opened a small gate, defended with a very dense palisade, and admitted the most daring of the assailants, who swung themselves over the palings. Being now more numerous they began to hack at the portcullis, which was not protected with iron on the inside, while others joined in hacking it from outside, to help them. While the Xanthians, with loud cries, were rushing upon the Romans who were at the temple of Sarpedon, the Romans within and without, who were demolishing the portcullis, fearful for their comrades, struggled with frantic zeal. Finally they broke it down and rushed through in crowds about sunset, with a loud shout intended as a signal to those in the temple.

80 1 When the city was taken the Xanthians ran to their houses and killed those dearest to them, all of whom willingly offered themselves to the slaughter. Upon hearing cries of lamentation, <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> thought that plundering was going on, and he gave orders to the army to stop it; but when he knew what the facts were he commiserated the freedom-loving spirit of the citizens, and sent messengers to offer them terms. They hurled missiles at the messengers, and, after destroying their own families, placed the bodies on funeral piles, which they had previously erected in their houses, set fire to them, and slew themselves on the same. <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> saved such of the temples as he could, but he captured only the slaves of the Xanthians; and of the citizens a few free women and hardly 150 men.

Thus the Xanthians perished the third time by their own hands on account of their love of liberty; for when the city was besieged by <persName n="226">Harpagus</persName>, the Mede, the general of <persName n="140">Cyrus the Great</persName>, they destroyed themselves in like manner rather than be enslaved, and the city then became the tomb of the Xanthians hemmed in by <persName n="226">Harpagus</persName>; and it is said that they suffered a similar fate at the hands of <persName n="10">Alexander</persName>, the son of <persName n="409">Philip</persName>, as they would not submit to obey him even after he had become the master of so large a portion of the earth.

81 1 <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> went from Xanthus down to Patara, a city which was something like a seaport of the Xanthians. He surrounded it with his army and ordered the inhabitants to obey him in everything, under penalty of meeting the fate of the Xanthians. Certain Xanthians were brought to them who lamented their own misfortunes and advised them to adopt wiser counsels. As the inhabitants of Patara made no sort of answer to the Xanthians, <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> gave them the remainder of the day to consider the matter, and went away. The next morning he moved his troops forward. The Patarans cried out from the walls that they would obey all his commands and opened their gates. He came in, but he neither killed nor banished anybody; but he ordered them to deliver to him whatever gold and silver the city possessed, and each citizen to bring in his private holdings under the same penalties and rewards to informers as those proclaimed by <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> at Rhodes. They obeyed his order. One slave testified that his master had concealed his gold and showed it to a centurion who was sent to find it. All the parties were brought before the tribunal. The master remained silent, but his mother, who had followed in order to save her son, cried out that she had concealed the gold. The slave, although not interrogated, disputed with her, saying that she lied and that his master had concealed it. <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> approved of the young man's silence and sympathized with his mother's grief. He allowed them both to depart unharmed and to take their gold with them, and he crucified the slave for officious zeal in accusing his superiors.

82 1 At the same time <persName n="262">Lentulus</persName>, who had been sent to Andriace, the seaport of the Myreans, broke the chain which closed the harbour and ascended to Myra. As the inhabitants obeyed his commands, he collected money in the same way as at Patara and returned to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>. The confederation of Lycia sent ambassadors to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> promising to form a military league with him and to contribute what money they could. He imposed taxes on them and he restored the free Xanthians to their city. He ordered the Lycian fleet together with his own ships, to set sail for Abydus; where he would rendezvous with his land forces and await <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, who was coming from Ionia, so that they might cross over to Sestus together. When <persName n="379">Murcus</persName>, who was at Peloponnesus lying in wait for <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName>, learned that her fleet had been damaged by a storm on the Libyan coast, and saw the wreckage borne by the waves as far as Laconia, and knew that she had returned home with difficulty and in ill-health, he sailed for Brundusium in order that he might not be idle with so great a fleet. He came to anchor at the island lying opposite the harbour, and prevented the remainder of the enemy's army and supplies from passing over to Macedonia. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> fought him with the few war-ships that he had, and with towers which he mounted on floats, whenever he sent out detachments of his army on transports, waiting for a strong wind from the land, in order that they might not be captured by <persName n="379">Murcus</persName>. As he fared badly he called for help from <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, who was contending on the water with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> along the coast of Sicily for possession of that island.

83 1 With <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> the situation was as follows. Being the younger son of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, he was at first disregarded by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> in Spain as not likely to accomplish anything of importance on account of his youth and inexperience. He roamed about the ocean with a few followers, committing piracy and concealing the fact that he was <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. When larger numbers joined him for the purpose of pillage, and his force became powerful, he revealed his name. Presently those who had served with his father and his brother, and who were leading a vagabond life, drifted to him as their natural leader, and <persName n="39">Arabio</persName>, who had been deprived of his ancestral kingdom, as I have related previously, came to him from Africa. His forces being thus augmented, his doings were now more important than robbery, and as he flew from place to place the name of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> spread through the whole of Spain, which was the most extensive of the provinces; but he avoided coming to an engagement with the governors of it appointed by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. When <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> learned of his doings he sent <persName n="101">Carinas</persName> with a stronger army to fight him. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, however, being the more nimble of the two, would show himself and then disappear, and so he wore out his enemy and got possession of a number of towns, large and small.

84 1 Than <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> sent <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> as successor to <persName n="101">Carinas</persName> to prosecute the war against <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. While they were carrying on warfare on equal terms, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> was assassinated and the Senate recalled <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. The latter came to Massilia and there watched the course of events at Rome. Having been appointed commander of the sea with the same powers that his father had exercised, he did not yet come back to the city, but taking what ships he found in the harbours, and joining them with those he had brought from Spain, he put to sea. When the triumvirate was established he sailed to Sicily, and as <persName n="422">Pompeius Bithynicus</persName>, the governor, would not yield the island, he besieged him, until <persName n="235">Hirtius</persName> and <persName n="162">Fannius</persName>, two men who had been proscribed and had fled from Rome, persuaded <persName n="422">Pompeius Bithynicus</persName> to surrender Sicily to <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>.

85 1 In this way <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> possessed himself of Sicily, and thus had ships, and an island lying convenient to Italy, and an army, now of considerable size, composed of those whom he had before and those who had fled from Rome, both freedmen and slaves, or those sent to him by the Italian cities which had been proclaimed as prizes of victory for the soldiers. These cities dreaded a victory of the triumvirs more than anything else, and whatever they could do against them secretly they did. The wealthy citizens fled from a country that they could no longer consider their own and took refuge with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, who was near by and greatly beloved by all at that time. There were present with him also many seafaring men from Africa and Spain, skilled in naval affairs, so that <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> was well provided with officers, ships, troops, and money. When <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> learned these facts he sent <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName> with a fleet, as though it were an easy task, to come alongside of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> and destroy him, while he himself passed through Italy with the intention of joining <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName> at Rhegium. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> advanced with a large fleet to meet <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName>, and a naval engagement took place between them at the entrance of the straits near the promontory of Scyllaeum. The ships of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, being lighter and manned by better sailors, excelled in swiftness and skill, while those of the Romans, being of great tonnage and size, laboured heavily. When the usual rush of waves through the straits came on, and the sea dashed hither and thither under the influence of the current the crews of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> suffered less than their adversaries, because they were accustomed to the agitation of the waters; while those of <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName>, not having their sea-legs through want of experience, and being unable to work their oars, or manage their rudders, were thrown into confusion. Accordingly, about sunset, <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName> was the first to give the signal of retreat. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> withdrew also. The ships suffered about equally on both sides. <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName> retired to the port of Balarus, facing the straits, where he repaired what was left of his damaged and wasted fleet.

86 1 When <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> arrived he gave a solemn promise to the inhabitants of Rhegium and Vibo that they should be exempt from the list of prizes of victory, for he feared them on account of their nearness to the straits. As <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had sent him a hasty summons, he set sail to join the latter at Brundusium, having Sicily and <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> on his left hand; and postponing the conquest of the island for the time being. On the approach of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> withdrew a short distance from Brundusium in order that he might not be between <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and there he watched for the passage of the transports that were carrying the army across from Brundusium to Macedonia. The latter were escorted by triremes, but a strong and favourable wind having sprung up they darted across fearlessly, needing no escort. <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> was vexed, but he lay in wait for the empty ships on their return. Yet these returned, took on board the remainder of the soldiers, and crossed again with full sails until the whole army, together with <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, had passed over. Although <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> recognized that his plans were frustrated by some fatality, he held his position nevertheless, in order to hinder as much as possible the passage of the enemy's munitions and supplies, or supplementary troops. <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> was sent by <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> to co-operate with him in this work, which they deemed most useful, together with fifty additional ships, one legion, and a body of archers; for as the triumvirs did not have a plentiful supply of provisions from elsewhere, it was deemed important to cut off their convoys from Italy.

And so <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> and <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>, with their 130 war ships and a still greater number of small ones, and their large military force, sailed hither and thither harassing the enemy. 87 1 Meanwhile <persName n="143">Decidius Saxa</persName> and <persName n="387">Norbanus</persName>, whom <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had sent in advance with eight legions to Macedonia, proceeded from that country a distance of 1500 stades toward the mountainous part of Thrace until they had passed beyond the city of Philippi, and seized the passes of the Corpilans and the Sapaeans, tribes under the rule of <persName n="487">Rhascupolis</persName>, where lies the only known route of travel from Asia to Europe. Here was the first obstacle encountered by <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> after they had crossed over from Abydus to Sestus. <persName n="487">Rhascupolis</persName> and <persName n="488">Rhascus</persName> were brothers of the royal family of Thrace, ruling one country. They differed in opinion at that time in regard to the proper alliance. <persName n="488">Rhascus</persName> had taken up arms for <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="487">Rhascupolis</persName> for <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, each having 3000 horse. When the Cassians came to inquire about the roads, <persName n="487">Rhascupolis</persName> told them that the one by way of Aenus and Maronea was the short and usual and most travelled route, but that it led to the gorge of the Sapaeans, which was occupied by the enemy and hence was impassable, but the roundabout road was difficult and three times as long.

88 1 <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, thinking that the enemy had taken that position not to close the passage to them but had crossed to Thrace instead of Macedonia for want of provisions, marched toward Aenus and Maronea from Lysimacheia and Cardia, which enclose the isthmus of the Thracian Chersonesus like gates. The next day brought them to the gulf of Melas.7 Here they reviewed their army which contained in all nineteen legions of infantry. Of these <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> had eight and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> nine, not full, but among them were two legions that were nearly full,8 so that they mustered about 80,000 foot-soldiers. <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> had 4000 Gallic and Lusitanian horse, besides 2000 Thracian and Illyrian, Parthian and Thessalian. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> had 2000 Spanish and Gallic horse and 4000 mounted bowmen, Arabs, Medes, and Parthians. The allied kings and tetrarchs of the Galatians in Asia followed him, leading a large additional force of foot-soldiers and about 5000 horse.

89 1 Such was the size of the army reviewed by <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> at the gulf of Melas, and with it they advanced to battle, leaving the remainder of their forces on duty elsewhere. After performing a lustration for the army, they completed the payment of the promised donative still due to the soldiers. They had provided themselves with an abundant supply of money in order to propitiate them with gifts, especially the large number who had served under <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, lest at the sight or the name of the younger <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, who was advancing, they should change their minds. For which reason also it was deemed best to address the soldiers publicly. A large platform was built, upon which the generals took their places, accompanied by the senators only. The soldiers, both their own and their allies, stood around it below, filled with joy at the sight of their vast number, the most powerful force they had ever beheld. To both the generals their immense commands were an immediate source of the greatest hope and courage. This more than anything else confirmed the fidelity of the army to the generals, for common hopes generate good feeling. There was a great deal of noise, as is usual on such occasions. The heralds and trumpeters proclaimed silence, and, when this was obtained, <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, who was the elder of the two, advanced a little in front of his companions and spoke as follows:—

90 1 "A common peril, like the present, fellow-soldiers, is the first thing that binds us in a common fidelity to each other. The second is, that we have given you all that we have promised, and this is the surest guarantee for what we have promised you in the future. All our hopes rest in bravery — the bravery of you, fellow-soldiers, and of us whom you see on this platform, this large and noble body of senators. We have, as you see, the most abundant munitions of war, supplies, arms, money, ships, and auxiliaries both from Roman provinces and the allied kings. Why is it needful, then, to exhort you with words to zeal and unanimity — you whom a common purpose and common interests have brought together? As to the slanders that those two men, our enemies, have brought against us, you understand them perfectly, and it is for that reason that you were ready to take up arms with us. Yet it seems fitting to explain our reasons once more. These will prove to you that we have the most honourable and righteous cause for war.

91 1 "We raised <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> to his high place, serving him in war in conjunction with you and holding commands under him. We continued his friends so long that no one could imagine we conspired against him on account of any private grudge. It was in the time of peace that he sinned, not against us, his friends (for we were honoured by him even among his friends), but against the laws, against the order of the commonwealth. There was no longer any law supreme, either aristocratic or plebeian, nor any of the institutions that our fathers established when they expelled the kings and swore never to tolerate royal government again. We, descendants of the men who thus swore, sustained that oath and warded off the curse from ourselves. We could no longer endure that one man, although he was our friend and benefactor, should take from the people and vest in himself the control of the public money, the armies, and the elections, and from the Senate the appointment of governors of the provinces; that he should be a law in place of the laws, a sovereign in place of the sovereign people, an autocrat in place of the senate's authority, for every purpose.

92 1 "Perhaps you did not understand these matters particularly, but saw only his bravery in war. Yet you may easily learn about them now by observing only the part that concerns yourselves. You, of the people, when you go to the wars, obey your generals as masters in everything, but in time of peace you resume your mastery over us. The Senate deliberates first, in order that you may not make a slip, but you decide for yourselves; you give your votes by tribes, or by centuries; you choose the consuls, the tribunes, the praetors. In the comitia you pass judgment on the weightiest questions, and you decide rewards and punishments at your hands. This balance of powers, O citizens, has raised the empire to the summit of fortune and conferred honours upon those worthy of them, and the men thus honoured have returned thanks to you. By virtue of this power you made Scipio consul when you bore testimony to his deeds in Africa, and you elected whom you pleased each year as tribunes, to oppose us in your interest if necessary. But why should I repeat so many things that you already know?

93 1 "From the time when <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s domination began you no longer elected any magistrate, either praetor, or consul, or tribune. Nor did you bear testimony to anybody's deeds, nor if you had done so, could you have rewarded them. In a word, nobody owed you any thanks either for a magistracy or a governorship, either for approving his accounts or acquitting him on a trial. Most lamentable of all, you could not defend your tribunes against insult, whose office you had constituted your own peculiar and perpetual magistracy, and had made sacred and inviolable. Yet you saw these inviolable men despoiled with contumely of this inviolable office, and of their sacred vestments, without trial, at the order of one man, because in your behalf they saw fit to proceed against certain persons who wished to proclaim him as king. The senators were deeply grieved at this on your account, for the office of tribune is yours, not theirs. But they were not able to censure this man openly or to bring him to trial by reason of the strength of the armies which, although heretofore belonging to the republic, he had made his own. So they adopted the only remaining method to ward off tyranny, and that was to conspire against the person of the tyrant.

94 1 "It was necessary that the decision should be that of the best men, but that the deed should be done by a few. When it was done the Senate voiced the general approval clearly by proposing rewards to the tyrannicides. But since <persName n="27">Antony</persName> restrained them from doing so on the pretext that it would lead to disorder, and since it was not our intention to confer this benefit upon Rome for the sake of the reward, but solely for the sake of the country, the senators refrained, not wishing to insult <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, but only to get rid of the tyranny. So they voted amnesty for all, and it was more particularly decreed that there should be no prosecution for the murder. After a little, when <persName n="27">Antony</persName> excited the mob against us, the Senate gave us command of the largest provinces and armies, and ordered all the countries between Syria and the Adriatic to obey us. In so doing did they punish us as monsters, or did they rather distinguish us as tyrannicides with the royal purple and with the rods and axes? For like reason the Senate recalled from exile the younger <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> (who was not concerned in this conspiracy) because he was the only son of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, who first took up arms to defend the republic, and because the young man had made some little opposition to the tyranny in a private way in Spain. It passed a decree also to pay back to him, out of the public funds, the value of his father's property, and it appointed him admiral in order that he also might hold a command because he was on the side of the republic. What more could you ask of the Senate by way of deed or of sign to show that everything was done with their approval, unless that they should declare it to you in so many words? But they will do and say this very thing, and saying it they will repay you with magnificent gifts, when they are able to speak and to requite your services.

95 1 "What their present situation is you know. They are proscribed without trial, and their property is confiscated. Without being condemned, they are put to death in their houses, in the streets, in temples, by soldiers, by slaves, by personal enemies. They have been dragged out of their hiding-places and pursued everywhere, although the laws allow anybody to go into voluntary exile. In the forum, where the head of an enemy was never carried, but only captured arms and the beaks of ships, the heads of those who were lately consuls, praetors, tribunes, aediles, and knights are exhibited. Rewards have been assigned for these horrors. This is a breaking out of all the wounds that had been previously healed over, — sudden seizure of men, and all kinds of infamy perpetrated by wives and sons, freedmen and slaves. Into so desperate a plight and such condition has the city now been plunged. The leaders of evil men in all this are the triumvirs, who proscribe their own brothers and uncles and guardians first of all. History tells us that the city was once captured by the most savage barbarians, but the Gauls never cut off any heads, they never insulted the dead, they never begrudged their enemies a chance to hide or fly. Nor did we ever treat in this way any city that we had captured in war, nor did we ever hear of others doing so. Moreover, it is no ordinary city, but the mistress of the world, that is thus wronged by those who have been chosen to set in order and regulate the republic. What did Tarquin ever do like this, — Tarquin, whom our ancestors hurled from the throne for an insult to one woman under the influence of passion, and then for that one act, resolved to be ruled by kings no longer?

96 1 "While the triumvirs are committing these outrages, O citizens, they call us infamous wretches. They say they are avenging <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> when they proscribe men who were not even in Rome when he was killed. Very many of these are here, as you see, who have been proscribed on account of their wealth, their family, or their preference for republican government. For this reason <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> was proscribed with us, although he was far away in Spain when we did the deed. Because he is the son of a republican father (for which reason also he was recalled by the Senate and made commander of the sea), he was proscribed by the triumvirs. What part had those women in the conspiracy against <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, who have been condemned to pay tribute? What part had those plebeians who holding property up to the value of 100,000 drachmas have been ordered to submit it to valuation under pressure of informers and fines? and what is more new taxes and contributions have been imposed upon them. And even while levying these exactions the triumvirs have not fully paid the sums promised to their troops, while we, who have done nothing contrary to justice, have given you all that we promised and have other funds ready for still larger rewards. So it comes about that the gods favour us because we do what is just.

97 1 "Besides the favour of the gods you can see that we have that of mankind by looking at these, your fellow-citizens, whom you have often beheld as your generals and your consuls, and who have won your praises as such. You see that they have had recourse to us as to men doing right and defending the republic. They espouse our cause, they offer up their prayers, and they co-operate with us for what still remains to be done. Far more just are the rewards which we have offered to those who rescue them than those which the triumvirs offer for killing them. The triumvirs know that we, who killed <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> because he assumed the monarchy, would not tolerate them in assuming his power and that we would not assume it ourselves, but that we would restore to the people in common the government as we received it from our ancestors. So you see the two sides do not decide to take up arms for the same reason — the enemy aiming at monarchy and despotism, as their proscription already proves, while we seek nothing but the mere privilege of living as private citizens under the laws of our country made once more free. Naturally the men before you espouse our side as the gods had done previously. In war the greatest hope lies in the justice of one's cause.

98 1 "Let it give no one any concern that he has been one of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s soldiers. We were not his soldiers then, but our country's. The pay and the rewards given were not <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s, but the republic's. For the same reason you are not now the soldiers of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, or of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, but of Rome. We, Roman generals, are your fellow-soldiers. If our enemies were of the same spirit with ourselves it would be possible for all to lay down their arms without danger, and give back all the armies to the commonwealth, and let it choose what will be most fitting. If they will accept such terms, we challenge them to do so. Since they will not (for they could not, on account of the proscription and the other things they have done), let us go forward, fellow-soldiers, with unwavering confidence and honest zeal, fighting only for the freedom of the Senate and people of Rome."

99 1 They all cried out, "Forward!" and urged him to lead them on immediately. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> was delighted with their spirit, and again proclaimed silence and again addressed them, saying: "May the gods who preside over just wars and over good faith reward your zeal, fellow-soldiers. How far superior we are to the enemy in everything that the human foresight of generals can provide let me tell you. We are equal to them in the number of legions, although we have left behind us the large detachments needed in many places. In cavalry and ships we greatly surpass them, as also in auxiliaries from kings and nations as far as the Medes and Parthians. Besides this we have to deal only with an enemy in front, while <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> is co-operating with us in Sicily in their rear, and in the Adriatic <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> and <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> with a large fleet and abundance of small craft, — besides two legions of soldiers and a body of archers, are cruising hither and thither harassing them in various ways, while both land and sea in our rear are clear of enemies. As regards money, which some call the sinews of war, they are destitute. They cannot pay what they have promised their army. The proceeds of the proscription have not met their expectation, because no good man will buy lands entailed with hate. Nor can they obtain resources elsewhere, since Italy is exhausted by civil strife, exactions, and proscriptions. Thanks to abundant foresight, we have plenty for the present, so that we can give you more shortly, and there are other large sums on the road collected from the nations behind us.

100 1 "Provisions, the supply of which is the chief difficulty in large armies, they can obtain only from Macedonia, a mountainous region, and the narrow country of Thessaly, and these must be carried to them overland with severe labour. If they try to obtain any from Africa, or Lucania, or Apulia, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, <persName n="379">Murcus</persName>, and <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> will cut them off entirely. We have abundance, brought to us daily by sea without labour from all the islands and mainlands which lie between Thrace and the river Euphrates, and without hindrance, since we have no enemy in our rear. So it rests with us either to hasten the battle, or by delaying to waste the enemy with hunger. Such and so great, fellow-soldiers, are our preparations, so far as they depend on human foresight. May the future event correspond to these preparations by your efforts and by the help of the gods. As we have paid you all that we promised for your former exploits and have rewarded your fidelity with abundant gifts, so for this greater battle we will, under the favour of the gods, provide you a reward worthy of it. And now, to increase the zeal with which you already advance to your task, and in remembrance of this assembly and of these words, we will make an additional gift from this platform — to each soldier 1500 Italic drachmas, to each centurion five times that sum, and to each tribune in proportion."

101 1 Having thus spoken, and having put his army in good spirits by deed and word and gifts, he dissolved the assembly. The soldiers remained a long time heaping praises on <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and promising to do their duty. The generals immediately counted out the money to them, and to the bravest awarded an additional sum on various pretexts. As they received their pay they were dismissed by detachments on the march to Doriscus, and the generals themselves followed soon afterward. Two eagles alighted upon the two silver eagles which surmounted the standards, pecking at them, or, as others say, protecting them, and there they remained, being fed by the generals from the public stores until the day before the battle, when they flew away. After marching two days round the gulf of Melas the army came to Aenus and thence to Doriscus and the other towns on the coast as far as Mount Serrium.

102 1 As Mount Serrium projected into the sea <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> turned to the mainland, but they sent <persName n="567">Tillius Cimber</persName> with the fleet and one legion of troops and some archers to sail around the promontory, which, although fertile, was formerly deserted because the Thracians were not accustomed to the sea and avoided the coast for fear of pirates. So the Chalcideans and other Greeks took possession of it, being seafaring people, and caused it to flourish with commerce and agriculture, and the Thracians were much gratified by the opportunity for the exchange of products. Finally <persName n="409">Philip</persName>, the son of <persName n="18">Amyntas</persName>, drove out the Chalcideans and other Greeks so that no traces of them were to be seen except the ruins of their temples. <persName n="567">Tillius Cimber</persName> sailed along this promontory, which was again deserted, as he had been ordered to do by <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, measuring and mapping places suitable for camps, and approaching it with his ships now and then in order that the forces of <persName n="387">Norbanus</persName> might abandon the pass, under the belief that it was useless to hold it longer. And it turned out as he had anticipated, for on the appearance of the ships <persName n="387">Norbanus</persName> became alarmed for the Sapaean pass and called on <persName n="143">Decidius Saxa</persName> to hasten from that of the Corpilans to his assistance, which he did. As soon as the latter pass was abandoned <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> marched through it.

103 1 When the stratagem became manifest <persName n="387">Norbanus</persName> and <persName n="143">Decidius Saxa</persName> occupied the gorge of the Sapaeans strongly. Again <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and his men could find no passage. They fell into discouragement lest they should now have to begin the roundabout journey which they had disdained, and to turn upon their own tacks, although pressed by time and the lateness of the season. While they were in this mood <persName n="487">Rhascupolis</persName> said that there was a circuitous route (along the very side of the Sapaean mountain) of three days' march, which had been impassable to men up to this time on account of rocks, scarcity of water, and dense forests. If, however, they could carry their water and make a narrow but sufficient pathway, they would be so enveloped in shade that they would not be perceived even by birds. On the fourth day they would come to the river Harpessus, which falls into the Hermus, and in one day more they would be at Philippi, flanking the enemy so as to cut him off completely and leave him no chance to retreat. They adopted this plan since there was nothing else to do, and especially because it held out the hope of surrounding so large a force of the enemy.

104 1 They sent a detachment in advance under command of <persName n="280">Lucius Bibulus</persName>, in company with <persName n="487">Rhascupolis</persName>, to cut a path. They found it a very laborious task, but they accomplished it nevertheless with enthusiastic zeal, and all the more when some who had gone ahead came back and said that they had had a distant view of the river. On the fourth day, fatigued with labour and thirst, the water which they carried being nearly exhausted, they recollected that it had been said that they should be in a waterless region only three days. So they fell into a panic fearing that they were the victims of a stratagem. They did not disbelieve those who had been sent in advance and who said that they had seen the river, but they thought that they themselves were being led in a different direction. They lost heart and cried aloud, and when they saw <persName n="487">Rhascupolis</persName> riding by and exhorting them to have courage, they reviled him and threw stones at him. While <persName n="280">Lucius Bibulus</persName> was beseeching them with words of good cheer to persevere to the end, towards evening the river was seen by those in front, who, as was natural, raised a cry of joy, which was taken up by those behind in due order until it reached the rear. When <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> learned this they hurried forward at once, leading on the remainder of their army through the pathway that had been cleared. Nevertheless, they did not conceal their doings from the enemy altogether, nor surround them, for <persName n="488">Rhascus</persName>, the brother of <persName n="487">Rhascupolis</persName>, having his suspicions aroused by the shouting, made a reconnaissance; and when he saw what was being done he was astonished at so large an army traversing a pathway where no water could be obtained, and where he thought not even a wild beast could penetrate by reason of the dense foliage, and he forthwith communicated the news to the army of <persName n="387">Norbanus</persName>. The latter retreated by night from the gorge of the Sapaeans toward Amphipolis. Each of the Thracian brothers received high commendation in his own army, the one because he had led an army by a secret path, the other because he had discovered the secret.

105 1 Thus <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> by an astonishing act of audacity advanced to Philippi, where <persName n="567">Tillius Cimber</persName> also disembarked, and the whole army was there assembled. Philippi is a city that was formerly called Datus, and before that Crenides, because there are many springs bubbling around a hill there. <persName n="409">Philip</persName> fortified it because he considered it an excellent stronghold against the Thracians, and named it from himself, Philippi. It is situated on a precipitous hill and its size is exactly that of the summit of the hill. There are woods on the north through which <persName n="487">Rhascupolis</persName> led the army of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>. On the south is a marsh extending to the sea. On the east are the gorges of the Sapaeans and Corpileans, and on the west a very fertile and beautiful plain extending to the towns of Murcinus and Drabiscus and the river Strymon, about 350 stades. Here it is said that Persephone was carried off while gathering flowers, and here is the river Zygactes, in crossing which they say that the yoke of the god's chariot was broken, from which circumstance the river received its name. The plain slopes downward so that movement is easy to those descending from Philippi, but toilsome to those going up from Amphipolis.

106 1 There is another hill not far from Philippi which is called the Hill of Dionysus, in which are gold mines called the Asyla. Ten stades farther are two other hills, at a distance of eighteen stades from Philippi itself and eight stades from each other. On these hills <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> were encamped, the former on the southern and the latter on the northern of the two. They did not advance against the retreating army of <persName n="387">Norbanus</persName> because they learned that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was approaching, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> having been left behind at Epidamnus on account of sickness. The plain was admirably suited for fighting and the hill-tops for camping, since on one side of them were marshes and ponds stretching as far as the river Strymon, and on the other gorges destitute of roads and impassable. Between these hills, eight stades apart, lay the main pass from Europe to Asia as between gates. Across this space they built a fortification from camp to camp, leaving a gate in the middle, so that the two camps became virtually one. Alongside this fortification flowed a river, which is called by some the Ganga and by others the Gangites, and behind it was the sea, where they could keep their supplies and shipping in safety. Their depot was on the island of Thasos, 100 stades distant, and their triremes were anchored at Neapolis, at a distance of seventy stades.

107 1 <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> were satisfied with the position and proceeded to fortify their camps, but <persName n="27">Antony</persName> moved his army rapidly, wishing to anticipate the enemy in occupying Amphipolis as an advantageous position for the battle. When he found it already fortified by <persName n="387">Norbanus</persName> he was delighted. Leaving his supplies there and one legion, under the command of <persName n="413">Pinarius</persName>, he advanced with the greatest boldness and encamped in the plain at a distance of only eight stades from the enemy, and straightway the superiority of the enemy's situation and the inferiority of his own became evident. The former were on elevated ground, the latter on the plain; the former procured fuel from the mountains, the latter from the marsh; the former obtained water from a river, the latter from wells freshly dug; the former drew their supplies from Thasos, requiring carriage of only a few stades, while the latter was 350 stades from Amphipolis. Still it seems that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was compelled to do as he did, for there was no other hill, and the rest of the plain, lying in a sort of hollow, was liable to inundation at times from the river; for which reason also the fountains of water were found fresh and abundant in the wells that were dug there. <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s audacity, although he was driven to it by necessity, confounded the enemy when they saw him pitch his camp so near them and in such a contemptuous manner as soon as he arrived. He raised numerous towers and fortified himself on all sides with ditches, wall, and palisade. The enemy also completed their fortification wherever their work was defective. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, observing that <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s advance was reckless, extended his fortification at the only place where it was still wanting, from the camp to the marsh, a space which had been overlooked on account of its narrowness, so that there was now nothing unfortified except the cliffs on <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>'s flank and the marsh on that of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and the sea lying against the marsh. In the centre everything was intercepted by ditch, palisade, wall, and gates.

108 1 In this way both sides had fortified themselves, in the meantime making trial of each other by cavalry skirmishes only. When they had done all that they intended and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had arrived (for, although he was not yet strong enough for a battle, he could be carried along the ranks reclining in a litter), he and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> prepared for battle forthwith. <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> also drew out their forces on their higher ground, but did not come down. They decided not to give battle, hoping to wear out the enemy by want of supplies. There were nineteen legions of infantry on each side, but those of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> lacked something of being full, while those of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> were complete. Of cavalry the latter had 13,000 and the former 20,000, including Thracians on both sides. Thus in the multitude of men, in the spirit and bravery of the commanders, and in arms and munitions, was beheld a most magnificent display on both sides; yet they did nothing for several days. <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> did not wish to engage, but rather to continue wasting the enemy by lack of provisions, since they themselves had abundance from Asia, all transported by the sea from close at hand, all the enemy had nothing in abundance and nothing from their own territory. They could obtain nothing through merchants in Egypt, since that country was exhausted by famine, nor from Spain or Africa by reason of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, nor from Italy by reason of <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> and <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>. Macedonia and Thessaly, which were the only countries then supplying them, would not suffice much longer.

109 1 Mindful chiefly of these facts <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and his generals protracted the war. <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, fearful of the delay, resolved to force them to an engagement. He formed a plan of effecting a passage through the marsh secretly, if possible, in order to get in the enemy's rear without their knowledge, and cut off their avenue of supply from Thasos. So he arrayed his forces for battle with all the standards set each day, so that it might seem that his entire army was drawn up, while a part of his force was really working night and day making a narrow passage in the marsh, cutting down reeds, throwing up a causeway upon them, and flanking it with stone, so that the earth should not fall away, and bridging the deeper parts with piles, all in the profoundest silence. The reeds, which were still growing around his passage-way, prevented the enemy from seeing his work. After working ten days in this manner he sent a column of troops by night suddenly, who occupied all the strong positions within his lines and built several redoubts at the same time. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> was amazed at the ingenuity as well as the secrecy of this work, and he formed the counter design of cutting <persName n="27">Antony</persName> off from his redoubts. He carried a transverse wall across the whole marsh from his camp to the sea, cutting and bridging in the same manner as <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had done, and setting up the palisade on the top of his mounds, thus intercepting the passage made by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, so that those inside could not escape to him, nor he render assistance to them.

110 1 When <persName n="27">Antony</persName> saw this about noon, instantly, with rage and fury, he turned his own army, which was facing in another direction, and led it against the cross-fortification of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> between his camp and the marsh. He carried tools and ladders intending to take it by storm and force his way into <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>' camp. While he was making this audacious charge, obliquely and up hill, across the space that separated the two armies, the soldiers of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> were provoked at the insolence of the enemy in dashing boldly athwart their front while they stood there armed. So they charged on their own account, without any order from their officers, and killed with much slaughter (as natural in a flank attack) all they came up with. The battle once begun they charged upon the army of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, also, which was drawn up opposite, put it to flight, pursued it to the camp which <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had in common, and captured it. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> himself was not there, having been warned in a dream to beware of that day, as he has himself written in his Memoirs.

111 1 When <persName n="27">Antony</persName> saw that battle was joined he was delighted because he had forced it, for he had been in trouble about his supplies he judged it inadvisable to turn again toward the plain, lest in making the evolution his ranks should be thrown into disorder. So he continued his charge, as he had begun it, on the run, and advanced under a shower of missiles, and forced his way till he struck the troop of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> which had not moved from its assigned position and which was amazed at this unexpected audacity. He courageously broke this advance guard and dashed against the fortification that ran between the marsh and the camp, demolished the palisade, filled up the ditch, undermined the works, and killed the men at the gates, disregarding the missiles hurled from the wall, until he had forced an entrance through the gates, and others had made breaches in the fortification, and still others had climbed up on the débris. All this was done so swiftly that those who had just now captured the fortification met <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>' men, who had been at work in the marsh, coming to the assistance of their friends, and, with a powerful charge, put them to flight, drove them into the marsh, and then at once wheeled against the camp of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> itself. These were only the men who had scaled the fortification with <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, the remainder being engaged in conflict with the enemy on the other side of the wall.

112 1 As the camp was in a strong position it was guarded by only a few men, for which reason <persName n="27">Antony</persName> easily overcame them. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>' soldiers outside the camp were already being beaten, and when they saw that the camp was taken they scattered in disorderly flight. The victory was complete and alike on either side, <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> defeating the enemy's left wing and taking their camp, while <persName n="27">Antony</persName> overcame <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and ravaged his camp with irresistible courage. There was great slaughter on both sides, but by reason of the extent of the plain and the clouds of dust they were ignorant of each other's fate. When they learned the facts they recalled their scattered forces. Those who returned resembled porters rather than soldiers, and did not at once perceive each other nor see anything clearly. Otherwise either party would have flung down their burdens and fiercely attacked the others carrying off plunder in this disorderly fashion. According to conjecture the number of killed on the side of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, including slave shield-bearers, was about 8000, and on the side of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> double that number.

113 1 When <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> was driven out of his fortifications and no longer had even a camp to go to, he hurried up the hill to Philippi and took a survey of the situation. As he could not see accurately on account of the dust, nor could he see everything, but only that his own camp was captured, he ordered <persName n="414">Pindarus</persName>, his shield-bearer, to fall upon him and kill him. While <persName n="414">Pindarus</persName> still delayed a messenger ran up and said that <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> had been victorious on the other wing, and was ravaging the enemy's camp. <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> merely answered, "Tell him that I pray his victory may be complete." Then, turning to <persName n="414">Pindarus</persName>, he said, "What are you waiting for? Why do you not deliver me from my shame?" Then, as he presented his throat, <persName n="414">Pindarus</persName> slew him. This is one account of the death of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>. Others say that as some horsemen were approaching, bringing the good news from <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, he took them for enemies and sent <persName n="569">Titinius</persName> to find out exactly; that the horsemen pressed around <persName n="569">Titinius</persName> joyfully as a friend of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, and at the same time uttered loud hurrahs; that <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, thinking that <persName n="569">Titinius</persName> had fallen into the hands of enemies, said, "Have I waited to see my friend torn from me?" and that he withdrew to a tent with <persName n="414">Pindarus</persName>, and <persName n="414">Pindarus</persName> was never seen afterward. For this reason some persons think that he killed <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> without orders.

Thus <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> ended his life on his birthday, on which, as it happened, the battle was fought, and <persName n="569">Titinius</persName> killed himself because he had been too late; 114 1 and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> wept over the dead body of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and called him the last of the Romans, meaning that his equal in virtue would never exist again. He reproached him for haste and precipitancy, but at the same time he esteemed him happy because he was freed from cares and troubles, "which," he said, "are leading <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, whither, ah, whither?" He delivered the corpse to friends to be buried secretly lest the army should be moved to tears at the sight; and himself passed the whole night, without food and without care for his own person, restoring order in <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>' army. In the morning the enemy drew up their army in order of battle, so that they might not seem to have been beaten. <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, perceiving their design, exclaimed, "Let us arm also and make believe that we have suffered defeat." So he put his forces in line, and the enemy withdrew. <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> said to his friends, jestingly, "They challenged us when they thought we were tired out, but they dared not put us to the test."

115 1 On the same day that witnessed the battle at Philippi another great calamity took place in the Adriatic. <persName n="215">Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus</persName> was bringing two legions of infantry on transport ships to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, one of which was known as the Martian legion, a name which had been given to it as a distinction for bravery. He led also a praetorian cohort of about 2000 men, four squadrons of horse, and a considerable body of other troops, under the convoy of a few triremes. <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> and <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> met them with 130 war-ships. A few of the transports that were in front got away under sail. But the wind suddenly failing, the rest drifted about in a dead calm on the sea, delivered by some god into the hands of their enemies. For the latter, without danger to themselves, fell upon each ship and crushed it; nor could the triremes that escorted them render any aid, since they were hemmed in by reason of their small number. The men who were exposed to this danger performed many deeds of valour. Sometimes they hastily warped their ships together with ropes and made them fast with spars to prevent the enemy from breaking through their line. But when they succeeded in doing this <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> discharged burning arrows at them. Then they cast off their fastenings as quickly as possible and separated from each other on account of the fire and thus again were exposed to being surrounded or rammed by the triremes.

116 1 Some of the soldiers, and especially the Martians, who excelled in bravery, were exasperated that they should lose their lives uselessly, and so killed themselves rather than be burned to death; others leaped on board the triremes of the enemy, selling their lives dearly. Vessels half burned floated a long time, containing men perishing by fire, or hunger, and thirst. Others, clinging to masts or planks, were thrown upon barren rocks or promontories, and of these some were saved unexpectedly. Some of them even lasted for five days by licking pitch, or chewing sails or ropes, until the waves bore them to the land. The greater part, vanquished by their misfortunes, surrendered to the enemy. Seventeen triremes surrendered, and the men in them took the oath to <persName n="379">Murcus</persName>. Their general, <persName n="215">Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus</persName>, who was believed to have perished, returned to Brundusium on his ship five days later.

Such was the catastrophe that befell in the Adriatic on the same day that the battle of Philippi was fought, whether it be more fitly called a naval catastrophe or a naval battle. The coincidence of the two battles caused amazement when it became known later.

117 1 <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> assembled his army and addressed it as follows: "In yesterday's engagement, fellow-soldiers, you were in every respect superior to the enemy. You began the battle eagerly, although without orders, and you utterly destroyed their far-famed fourth legion on which their wing placed its reliance, and all those supporting it as far as their camp, and you took and plundered their camp first, so that our victory far outweighs the disaster on our left wing. But when it was in your power to finish the whole work, you chose rather to plunder than to kill the vanquished; for most of you passed by the enemy and made a rush for his property. We are the superior again in this, that of our two camps they captured only one, while we took all of theirs, so that here our gain is twice as great as our loss. So great are our advantages in the battle. How far we excel them in other respects you may learn from our prisoners — concerning the scarcity and dearness of provisions among them, the difficulty of procuring further supplies, and how near they are to absolute want. They can obtain nothing from Sicily, Sardinia, Africa, or Spain, because <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, <persName n="379">Murcus</persName>, and <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> with 260 ships close the sea against them. They have already exhausted Macedonia. They are now dependent on Thessaly alone. How much longer will it suffice?

118 1 "When, therefore, you see them eager to fight, bear in mind that they are so pressed by hunger that they prefer death by battle. We will make it part of our plan that hunger shall engage them before we do, so that when it is necessary to fight we shall find them weakened and exhausted. Let us not be carried away by our ardour before the proper time. Let no one think that my generalship has become sloth rather than action, when he casts his eye on the sea behind us, which sends us all this aid and provisions and enables us to win victory without danger if you wait and do not mind the insults and provocations of the enemy, who are not braver than ourselves, as yesterday's work shows, but are trying to avert another danger. Let the zeal which I now desire you to repress be shown abundantly when I ask it. The rewards of victory I myself will pay you in full when it shall please the gods that our work be finished. And now for your bravery in yesterday's engagement, I will give to each soldier 1000 drachmas and to your officers in proportion."

After speaking thus he distributed the donative to the legions in their order. Some writers say that he promised to give them also the cities of Lacedaemon and Thessalonica to plunder.

119 1 Meanwhile <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, seeing that <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> was not willing to fight, assembled their men, and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> addressed them thus: "Soldiers, I am sure that the enemy claim in their speeches a share of yesterday's victory because they drove some of us and plundered our camp, but they will show by their action that it was wholly yours. For I promise you that neither to‑morrow nor on any subsequent day will they be willing to fight. It is the clearest proof of their defeat yesterday and of their lack of courage, that like those who have been vanquished in public games, they keep out of the arena. Surely they did not collect so numerous an army in order to pass their time in fortifications in the desert parts of Thrace. But they built their fortifications when you were still approaching because they were afraid; and now that you have come they adhere to them because of yesterday's defeat, for which also the older and more experienced of their generals in utter despair committed suicide, and this act is itself the greatest proof of their disaster. Since, therefore, they do not accept our challenge and come down from the mountain, but trust to their precipices instead of their arms, be valiant, O my soldiers of Rome, and force them to it again as you forced them yesterday. Let us consider it base to yield to those who are afraid of us, to keep our hands off such sluggards, or, soldiers as we are, to be men weaker than walls. We did not come hither to pass our lives in this plain, and if we delay we shall be in want of everything. If we are well advised we shall prosecute the war sharply, in order that peace may be of the longest duration possible.

120 1 "We, who have not incurred your censure for the onset and the plan of yesterday's battle, will devise fresh opportunities and means for this end. Do you, on the other hand, when you are asked, repay your generals with your valour. Nor must you be troubled, for a moment, by yesterday's plundering of our camp, for wealth consists not in the property we hold, but in conquering with might, which will restore to us as victors not only what we lost yesterday, which is still safe in the enemy's possession, but the enemy's wealth in addition. And if we are in haste to take these things let us hasten to bring on a battle. What we took from them yesterday balances what we lost, and perhaps more, for they brought with them all that they had extorted and plundered from Asia, while you, coming from your own country, left at home everything in the way of luxury, and brought with us only what was necessary. If there was anything lavish in our camp it was the property of your generals, who will gladly give it all to you as a reward for your victory. However, as compensation even for this loss we will give you an additional reward of 5000 drachmas for each soldier, five times as much to each centurion, and twice the latter sum to each tribune."

121 1 Having spoken thus, he marshalled his men again on the following day. As the enemy would not come down even then, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was disgusted, but he continued to lead out his men daily. <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> had a part of his army in line lest he should be compelled to fight; and with another part he guarded the road by which his supplies were conveyed. There was a hill very near the camp of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, which it was difficult for an enemy to occupy, because by reason of its nearness, it was exposed to arrows from the camp. Nevertheless, <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> had placed a guard on it, lest any one should make bold to attack it. As it had been abandoned by <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, the army of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> occupied it by night with four legions and protected themselves with wickerwork and hides against the enemy's bowmen. When this position was secured they transferred ten other legions a distance of more than five stades toward the sea. Four stades farther they placed two legions, in order to extend themselves in this manner quite to the sea, with a view of breaking through the enemy's line either along the sea itself, or through the marsh, or in some other way, and to cut off their supplies. <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> counteracted this movement by building fortified posts opposite their camps and in other ways.

122 1 The task of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> became pressing, hunger was already felt, and in view of the magnitude of the coming famine the fear of it grew upon them more and more each day, for Thessaly could no longer furnish sufficient supplies, nor could they hope for anything from the sea, which was commanded by the enemy everywhere. News of their recent disaster in the Adriatic having now reached both armies, it caused them fresh alarm, as also did the approach of winter while they were quartered in this muddy plain. Moved by these considerations they sent a legion of troops to Achaia at once to collect all the food they could find and send it to them in haste. As they could not rest under so great an impending danger, and as their other artifices were of no avail, they ceased offering battle in the plain and advanced with shouts to the enemy's fortifications, and challenged <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> to fight, reviling and scoffing at him, intending not so much to besiege him as by a mad assault to force him to an engagement.

123 1 But <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> adhered to his original intention, and all the more because he knew of the famine and of his own success in the Adriatic, and of the enemy's desperation for want of supplies. He preferred to endure a siege, or anything else rather than come to an engagement with men desperate for hunger, and whose hopes rested solely on fighting because they despaired of every other resource. His soldiers, however, without reflection, entertained a different opinion. They took it hard that they should be shut up, idle and cowardly, like women, within their fortifications. Their officers also, although they approved of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>' design, were vexed, thinking that in the present temper of the army they might overpower the enemy more quickly. <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> himself was the cause of these murmurs, being of a gentle and kindly disposition toward all — not like <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, who had been austere and imperious in every way, for which reason the army obeyed his orders promptly, not interfering with his authority, and not criticising them when they had learned them. But in the case of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> they expected nothing else than to share the command with him on account of his mildness of temper. Finally, the soldiers began more and more openly to collect together in companies and groups and to ask each other, "Why does our general put a stigma upon us? How have we offended lately — we who conquered the enemy and put him to flight; we who slaughtered those opposed to us and took their camp?" <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> took no notice of these murmurs, nor did he call an assembly, lest he should be forced from his position, contrary to his dignity, by the unreasoning multitude, and especially by the mercenaries, who, like fickle slaves seeking new masters, always rest their hopes of safety on desertion to the enemy.

124 1 His officers also kept irritating him and urging him to make use of the eagerness of the army now, which would speedily bring glorious results. If the battle should turn out adversely, they could fall back to their walls and put the same fortifications between themselves and the enemy. <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> was especially vexed with these, for they were his officers, and he grieved that they, who were exposed to the same peril as himself, should capriciously side with the soldiers in preferring a quick and doubtful chance to a victory without danger; but, to the ruin of himself and them, he yielded, chiding them with these words, "I seem likely to carry on war like <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, not so much commanding now as commanded." I think that <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> restricted himself to these words in order to conceal his greatest fear, lest those of his soldiers who had formerly served under <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> should become disaffected and desert to the enemy. This both himself and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> had suspected from the beginning, and they had been careful not to give any excuse for such disaffection toward themselves.

125 1 So <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> led out his army unwillingly and formed them in line of battle before his walls, ordering them not to advance very far from the hill so that they might have a safe retreat if necessary and a good position for hurling darts at the enemy. In each army the men exchanged exhortations with each other. There was great eagerness for battle, and exaggerated confidence. On the one side was the fear of famine, on the other a proper shame that they had constrained their general to fight when he still favoured delay, and fear lest they should come short of their promises and prove weaker than their boastings, and expose themselves to the charge of rashness instead of winning praise for good counsel, and because <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> also, riding through the ranks on horseback, showed himself before them with a solemn countenance and reminded them of these things in such words as the opportunity offered. "You have chosen to fight," he said; "you have forced me to battle when I could conquer otherwise. Do not falsify my hopes or your own. You have the advantage of the higher ground and everything safe in your rear. The enemy's position is the one of peril because he lies between you and famine."

With these words he passed on, the soldiers telling him to trust them and echoing his words with shouts of confidence. 126 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> rode through their own ranks shaking hands with those nearest them, urging them even more solemnly to do their duty and not concealing the danger of famine, because they believed that that would be an opportune incitement to bravery. "Soldiers," they said, "we have found the enemy. We have before us those whom we sought to catch outside of their fortifications. Let none of you shame his own challenge or prove unequal to his own threat. Let no one prefer hunger, that unmanageable and distressing evil, to the walls and bodies of the enemy, which yield to bravery, to the sword, to despair. Our situation at this moment is so pressing that nothing can be postponed till to‑morrow, but this very day must decide for us either a complete victory or an honourable death. If you conquer you gain in one day and by one blow provisions, money, ships, and camps, and the prizes of victory offered by ourselves. Such will be the result if, from our first onset upon them, we are mindful of the necessities urging us on and if, after breaking their ranks, we immediately cut them off from their gates and drive them upon the rocks or into the plain, so that the war may not spring up again or these enemies get away for another period of idleness — the only warriors, surely, who are so weak as to rest their hopes, not on fighting, but on declining to fight."

127 1 In this way <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> roused the spirit of those with whom they came in contact. The emulation of the troops was excited to show themselves worthy of their commanders and also to escape the danger of famine, which had been greatly augmented by the naval disaster in the Adriatic. They preferred, if necessary, to suffer in battle, with the hope of success, rather than be wasted by an irresistible foe.

Inspired by these thoughts, which each man exchanged with his neighbour, the spirit of the two armies was wonderfully raised and both were filled with undaunted courage. They did not now remember that they were fellow-citizens of their enemies, but hurled threats at each other as though they had been enemies by birth and descent, so much did the anger of the moment extinguish reason and nature in them. Both sides divined equally that this day and this battle would decide the fate of Rome completely; and so indeed it did.

128 1 The day was consumed in preparations till the ninth hour, when two eagles fell upon each other and fought in the space between the armies, amid the profoundest silence. When the one on the side of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> took flight his enemies raised a great shout and battle was joined. The onset was superb and terrible. They had little need of arrows, stones, or javelins, which are customary in war, for they did not resort to the usual manoeuvres and tactics of battles, but, coming to close combat with naked swords, they slew and were slain, seeking to break each other's ranks. On the one side it was a fight for self-preservation rather than victory: on the other for victory and for the satisfaction of the general who had been forced to fight against his will. The slaughter and the groans were terrible. The bodies of the fallen were carried back and others stepped into their places from the reserves. The generals flew hither and thither overlooking everything, exciting the men by their ardour, exhorting the toilers to toil on, and relieving those who were exhausted so that there was always fresh courage at the front.

Finally, the soldiers of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, either from fear of famine, or by the good fortune of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> himself (for certainly the soldiers of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> were not blameworthy), pushed back the enemy's line as though they were turning round a very heavy machine. The latter were driven back step by step, slowly at first and without loss of courage. Presently their ranks broke and they retreated more rapidly, and then the second and third ranks in the rear retreated with them, all mingled together in disorder, crowded by each other and by the enemy, who pressed upon them without ceasing until it became plainly a flight. The soldiers of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, then especially mindful of the order they had received, seized the gates of the enemy's fortification at great risk to themselves because they were exposed to missiles from above and in front, but they prevented a great many of the enemy from gaining entrance. These fled, some to the sea, and some through the river Zygactes to the mountains.

129 1 The enemy having been routed, the generals divided the remainder of the work between themselves, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> to capture those who should break out of the camp and to watch the main camp, while <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was everything, and attacked everywhere, falling upon the fugitives and those who still held together, and upon their other camping-places, crushing all alike with vehement impetuosity. Fearing lest the leaders should escape him and collect another army, he despatched cavalry upon the roads and outlets of the field of battle to capture those who were trying to escape. These divided their work; some of them hurried up the mountain with <persName n="488">Rhascus</persName>, the Thracian, who was sent with them on account of his knowledge of the roads. They surrounded the fortified positions and escarpments, hunted down the fugitives, and kept watch upon those inside. Others pursued <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> himself. <persName n="271">Lucilius</persName> seeing them rushing on furiously surrendered himself, pretending to be <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, and asked them to take him to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> instead of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>; for which reason chiefly he was believed to be <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> trying to avoid his implacable enemy. When <persName n="27">Antony</persName> heard that they were bringing him, he went to meet him, with a pause to reflect on the fortune, the dignity, and the virtue of the man, and thinking how he should receive <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>. As he was approaching, <persName n="271">Lucilius</persName> presented himself, and said with perfect boldness, "You have not captured <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, nor will virtue ever be taken prisoner by baseness. I deceived these men and so here I am." <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, observing that the horsemen were ashamed of their mistake, consoled them, saying, "The game you have caught for me is not worse, but better than you think — as much better as a friend is than an enemy." Then he committed <persName n="271">Lucilius</persName> to the care of one of his friends, and later took him into his own service and employed him in a confidential capacity.

130 1 <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> fled to the mountains with a considerable force, intending to return to his camp by night, or to move down to the sea. But since all the roads were encompassed by guards he passed the night under arms with all his party, and it is said that, looking up to the stars, he exclaimed:—

"Forget not, Zeus, the author of these ills,"9

referring to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. It is said that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> himself repeated this saying at a later period in the midst of his own dangers, regretting that when he might have associated himself with <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, he had become the tool of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. At the present time, however, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> passed the night under arms with his outposts over against <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, fortifying himself with a breastwork of dead bodies and spoils collected together. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> toiled til midnight and then retired on account of his illness, leaving <persName n="387">Norbanus</persName> to watch the enemy's camp.

131 1 On the following day <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, seeing the enemy still lying in wait for him, and having fewer than four full legions, which had ascended the mountain with him, thought it best not to address himself to his troops, but to their officers, who were ashamed and repentant of their fault. To them he sent to put them to the test and to learn whether they were willing to break through the enemy's lines and regain their own camp, which was still held by their troops who had been left there. These officers, though they had rushed to battle unadvisedly, had been of good courage for the most part, but now, for some divine infatuation was already upon them, gave to their general the undeserved answer that he should look out for himself, that they had tempted fortune many times, and that they would not throw away the last remaining hope of accommodation. Then <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> said to his friends, "I am no longer useful to my country if such is the temper of these men," and calling <persName n="547">Strato</persName>, the Epirote, who was one of his friends, gave him the order to stab him. While <persName n="547">Strato</persName> still urged him to deliberate, <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> called one of his servants. Then <persName n="547">Strato</persName> said, "Your friend shall not come short of your servants in executing your last commands, if the decision is actually reached." With these words he thrust his sword into the side of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, who did not shrink or turn away.

132 1 So died <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, two most noble and illustrious Romans, and of incomparable virtue, but for one crime; for although they belonged to the party of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> the Great, and had been the enemies, in peace and in war, of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, he made them his friends, and from being friends he was treating them as sons. The Senate at all times had a peculiar attachment to them, and commiseration for them when they fell into misfortune. On account of those two it granted amnesty to all the assassins, and when they took flight it bestowed governorships on them in order that they should not be exiles; not that it was disregardful of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> or rejoiced at what had happened to him, for it admired his bravery and good fortune, gave him a public funeral at his death, ratified his acts, and had for a long time awarded the magistracies and governorships to his nominees, considering that nothing better could be devised than what he proposed. But its zeal for these two men and its solicitude for them brought it under suspicion of complicity in the assassination — so much were those two held in honour by all. By the most illustrious of the exiles they were more honoured than <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, although he was nearer and not irreconcilable to the triumvirs, while they were farther away and irreconcilable.

133 1 When it became necessary for them to take up arms, two whole years had not elapsed ere they had brought together upward of twenty legions of infantry and something like 20,000 cavalry, and 200 ships of war, with corresponding apparatus and a vast amount of money, some of it from willing and some from unwilling contributors. They carried on wars with many peoples and with cities and with men of the adverse faction successfully. They brought under their sway all the nations from Macedonia to the Euphrates. Those whom they had fought against they had brought into alliance with them and had found them most faithful. They had had the services of the independent kings and princes, and in some small measure even of the Parthians, who were enemies of the Romans; but they did not wait for them to come and take part in the decisive battle, lest this barbarous and hostile race should become accustomed to encounters with the Romans. Most extraordinary of all was the fact that the greater part of their army had been the soldiers of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and wonderfully attached to him, yet they were won over by the very murderers of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and followed them more faithfully against <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s son than they had followed <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who was <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s companion in arms and colleague; for not one of them deserted <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> even when they were vanquished while some of them had abandoned <persName n="27">Antony</persName> at Brundusium before the war began. The reason for their service, both under <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> aforetime and now under <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, was not their own interest, but the cause of democracy; a specious name indeed, but always hurtful. Both of the leaders, when they thought they could no longer be useful to their country, alike despised their own lives. In that which related to their cares and labours <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> gave his attention strictly to war, like a gladiator to his antagonist. <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, wherever he might be, wanted to see and hear everything, having been a philosopher of no mean note.

134 1 Against all these virtues and merits must be set down the crime against <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, which was not an ordinary or a small one, for it was committed unexpectedly against a friend, ungratefully against a benefactor who had spared them in war, and nefariously against the head of the state, in the senate-house, against a pontiff clothed in his sacred vestments, against a ruler without equal, who was most serviceable above all other men to Rome and to its empire. For these reasons Heaven was incensed against them and often forewarned them of their doom. When <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> was performing a lustration for his army his lictor placed his garland upon him wrong side up; a Victory, a gilded offering of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, fell down. Many birds hovered over his camp, but uttered no sound, and swarms of bees continually settled upon it. While <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> was celebrating his birthday at Samos it is said that in the midst of the feast, although not a ready man with such quotations, he shouted out this verse without any apparent cause:—

Cruel fate

Hath slain me, aided by Latona's son."10

Once when he was about to cross from Asia to Europe with his army, and while he was awake at night and the light was burning low, he beheld an apparition of extraordinary form standing by him, and when he boldly asked who of men or gods it might be, the spectre answered, "I am thy evil genius, <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>. I shall appear to thee again at Philippi." And it is said that it did appear to him before the last battle.

When the soldiers were going out to the fight an Ethiopian met them in front of the gates, and as they considered this a bad omen they immediately cut him in pieces. It was due, too, to something more than human, no doubt, that <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> gave way to despair without reason after a drawn battle, and that <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> was forced from his policy of wise delay to an engagement with men who were pressed by hunger, while he himself had supplies in abundance and the command of the sea, so that his calamity proceeded rather from his own troops than from the enemy. Although they had participated in many engagements, they never received any hurt in battle, but both became the slayers of themselves, as they had been of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. Such was the punishment that overtook <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>.

135 1 <persName n="27">Antony</persName> found the body of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, wrapped it in the best purple garment, burned it, and sent the ashes to his mother, <persName n="520">Servilia</persName>, <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>'s army, when it learned of his death, sent envoys to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and obtained pardon, and was divided between their armies. It consisted of about 14,000 men. Besides these a large number who were in the forts surrendered. The forts themselves and the enemy's camp were given to the soldiers of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> to be plundered. Of the distinguished men in <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>' camp some perished in the battles, others killed themselves as the two generals had done, others purposely continued fighting till death. Among these men of note were <persName n="288">Lucius Cassius</persName>, a nephew of the great <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, and <persName n="105">Cato</persName> , the son of <persName n="104">Cato</persName>. The latter charged upon the enemy many times; then, when his men began to retreat, he threw off his helmet, either that he might be recognized, or be easily hit, or for both reasons. <persName n="249">Labeo</persName>, a man renowned for learning, father of the <persName n="250">Labeo</persName> who is still celebrated as a jurisconsult, dug a trench in his tent the size of his body, gave orders to his slaves in reference to the remainder of his affairs, made such arrangements as he desired for his wife and children, and gave letters to his domestics to carry to them. Then, taking his most faithful slave by the right hand and whirling him around, as is the Roman custom in granting freedom, he handed him a sword as he turned, and presented his throat. And so his tent became his tomb.

136 1 <persName n="488">Rhascus</persName>, the Thracian, brought many troops from the mountains. He asked and received as his reward the pardon of his brother, <persName n="487">Rhascupolis</persName>, from which it was made plain that from the beginning these Thracians had not been at variance with each other, but that seeing two great and hostile armies coming into conflict near their territory, they divided the chances of fortune in such a way that the victor might save the vanquished. <persName n="431">Porcia</persName>, the wife of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and sister of the younger <persName n="104">Cato</persName>, when she learned that both had died in the manner described, although very strictly watched by domestics, seized some hot embers that they were carrying on a brazier, and swallowed them. Of the other members of the nobility who escaped to Thasos some took ship from thence, others committed themselves with the remains of the army to the judgment of <persName n="129">Corvinus</persName> and <persName n="280">Lucius Bibulus</persName>, men of equal rank, to do for all what they should decide to do for themselves. These came to an arrangement with <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, whereby they delivered to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> on his arrival at Thasos the money and arms, besides abundant supplies and a great quantity of war material, there in store.

137 1 Thus did <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> by perilous daring and by two infantry engagements achieve a success, the like of which was never before known; for never before had such numerous and powerful Roman armies come in conflict with each other. These soldiers were not enlisted from the ordinary conscription, but were picked men. They were not new levies, but under long drill and arrayed against each other, not against foreign or barbarous races. Speaking the same language and using the same tactics, being of like discipline and power of endurance, they were for these reasons what we may call mutually invincible. Nor was there ever such fury and daring in war as here, when citizens contended against citizens, families against families, and fellow-soldiers against each other. The proof of this is that, taking both battles into the account, the number of the slain even among the victors appeared to be not fewer than among the vanquished.

138 1 Thus the army of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> confirmed the prediction of their generals, passing in one day and by one blow from extreme danger and famine and fear of destruction to lavish wealth, absolute security, and glorious victory. Moreover, that result came about which <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had predicted as they advanced into battle. Their form of government was decided by that day's work chiefly, and they have not gone back to democracy yet. Nor was there any further need of similar contentions with each other, except the strife between <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> not long afterward, which was the last that took place between Romans. The events that happened after the death of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, under <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> and the friends of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, who escaped with the very considerable remains of their extensive war material, were not to be compared to the former in daring or in the devotion of men, cities, and armies to their leaders; nor did any of the nobility, nor the Senate, nor the same glory, attend them as attended <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>.

1 1 After the death of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> returned to Italy, but <persName n="27">Antony</persName> proceeded to Asia, where he met <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName>, queen of Egypt, and succumbed to her charms at first sight. This passion brought ruin upon them and upon all Egypt besides. For this reason a part of this book will treat of Egypt — a small part, however, not worth mentioning in the title, since it is incidental to the narrative of the civil wars, which constitutes much the larger portion. Other similar civil wars took place after <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, but there was no one in command of all the forces as they had been. The latter wars were sporadic, till finally <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, the younger son of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, the last remaining leader of that faction, was slain, as <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> had been, <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> was deprived of his share of the triumvirate, and the whole government of the Romans was centred in two only, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. These events came about in the following manner.

2 1 <persName n="399">Parmesius</persName> had been left by <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> in Asia with a fleet and an army to collect money. After the death of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, not anticipating the like fate of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, he selected thirty ships belonging to the Rhodians, which he intended to man, and burned the rest, except the sacred one, so that they might not be able to revolt. Having done this he took his departure with his own ships and the thirty. <persName n="119">Clodius</persName>, who had been sent by <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> to Rhodes with thirteen ships, found the Rhodians in revolt (for <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> also was now dead). <persName n="119">Clodius</persName> took away the garrison, consisting of 3000 soldiers, and joined <persName n="399">Parmesius</persName>. They were joined by <persName n="581">Turulius</persName>, who had another numerous fleet and a large sum of money which he had previously extorted from Rhodes. To this fleet, which was now quite powerful, flocked those who were rendering service in various parts of Asia, and they manned the ships with soldiers as well as they could, and with slaves, prisoners, and inhabitants of the islands where they touched, as rowers. The son of <persName n="607">Cicero</persName> joined them, and others of the nobility who had escaped from Thasos. Thus in a short time there was a considerable gathering and organization of officers, soldiers, and ships. Having received additional forces under <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, with which he had brought Crete under subjection to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, they made sail to the Adriatic and united with <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> and <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>, who had a large force under their command. Some of these sailed with <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> to Sicily to join <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. The rest remained with <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> and formed a faction by themselves.

Such was the first reassembling of what remained of the war preparations of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>. 3 1 After the victory of Philippi <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> offered a magnificent sacrifice and awarded praise to their army. In order to provide the rewards of victory <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> went to Italy to divide the land among the soldiers and to settle the colonies. He chose this himself on account of his illness. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> went to the nations beyond the Aegean to collect the money that had been promised to the soldiers. They divided the provinces among themselves as before and took those of <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> besides. For it was decided, at the instance of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> to make Cisalpine Gaul independent, as the elder <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> had intended. <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> had been accused of betraying the affairs of the triumvirate to <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> and it was decided that if <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> should find that this accusation was false other provinces should be given to <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>. They dismissed from the military service the soldiers who had served their full time except 8000 who had asked to remain. These they took back and divided between themselves and formed them in praetorian cohorts. There remained to them, including those who had come over from <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, eleven legions of infantry and 14,000 horse. Of these <persName n="27">Antony</persName> took, for his foreign expedition, six legions and 10,000 horse. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had five legions and 4000 horse, but of these he gave two legions to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> in exchange for others that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had left in Italy under the command of <persName n="92">Calenus</persName>.

4 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> then proceeded toward the Adriatic; but when <persName n="27">Antony</persName> arrived at Ephesus he offered a splendid sacrifice to the city's goddess and pardoned those who, after the disaster to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, had fled to the temple as suppliants, except <persName n="406">Petronius</persName>, who had been privy to the murder of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, and <persName n="484">Quintus</persName>, who had betrayed <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> to <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> at Laodicea. Having assembled the Greeks and other peoples who inhabited the Asiatic country around Pergamos, and who were present on a peace embassy, and others who had been summoned thither, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> addressed them as follows: "Your King Attalus, O Greeks, left you to us in his will, and straightway we proved better to you than Attalus had been, for we released you from the taxes that you had been paying to him, until the action of popular agitators also among us made these taxes necessary. But when they became necessary we did not impose them upon you according to a fixed valuation so that we could collect an absolutely certain sum, but we required you to contribute a portion of your yearly harvest in order that we might share with you the vicissitudes of the seasons. When the publicans, who farmed these collections by the authority of the Senate, wronged you by demanding more than was due, <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> remitted to you one-third of what you had paid to them and put an end to their outrages: for he turned over to you the collection of the taxes from the cultivators of the soil. And this was the kind of man that our honourable citizens called a tyrant, and you contributed vast sums of money to the murderers of your benefactor and against us, who were seeking to avenge him.

5 1 "Now that just fortune has decided the war, not as you wished, but as was right, if we were to treat you as allies of our enemies we should be obliged to punish you. But as we are willing to believe that you were constrained to this course by necessity, we will release you from the heavier penalty, but we need money and land and cities as rewards for our soldiers. There are twenty-eight legions of infantry which, with the auxiliaries, amount to upwards of 170,000 men, besides cavalry and various other arms of the service. The vast sum that we need for such a vast number of men you can easily imagine. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> has gone to Italy to provide them with the land and the cities — to expropriate Italy, if we must speak plainly. That we may not be under the necessity of expelling you from your lands, cities, houses, temples, and tombs, we have assessed you for contribution not of all that you have (for you could not pay that), but a part, a very small part, which when you learn it, I think you will cheerfully pay. For what you contributed to our enemies in two years (and you gave them the taxes of ten years in that time) will be quite sufficient for us; but it must be paid in one year, because we are pressed by necessity. As you are sensible of our leniency toward you, I will merely add that the penalty imposed is not equal to any one of your deserts."

6 1 <persName n="27">Antony</persName> spoke thus of providing a donative for twenty-eight legions of infantry, whereas I think that they had forty-three legions when they came to their agreement at Mutina and made these promises, but the war had probably reduced them to this number. The Greeks, while he was still speaking, threw themselves upon the ground, declaring that they had been subjected to force and violence by <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, and that they were deserving of pity, not of punishment; that they would willingly give to their benefactors, but that they had been stripped by their enemies, to whom they had delivered not only their money, but, in default of money, their plate and their ornaments, and who had coined these things into money in their presence. Finally, they prevailed by their entreaties that the amount should be reduced to nine years' taxes, payable in two years. It was ordered that the kings, princes, and free cities should make additional contributions according to their means, respectively.

7 1 While <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was making the circuit of the provinces <persName n="285">Lucius Cassius</persName>, the brother of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, and some others, who feared for their own safety, when they heard of the pardon of Ephesus, presented themselves to him as suppliants. He released them all except those who had been privy to the murder of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>: to these alone he was inexorable. He gave relief to the cities that had suffered most severely. He released the Lycians from taxes altogether, and urged the rebuilding of Xanthus; he gave to the Rhodians Andros, Tenos, Naxos, and Myndus, which were taken from them not long afterward because they ruled them too harshly; he made Laodicea and Tarsus free cities and released them from taxes entirely, and those inhabitants of Tarsus who had been sold into slavery he liberated by an order. To the Athenians when they came to him to ask for Tenos he gave Aegina and Icos, Ceos, Sciathos, and Peparethos. Proceeding onward to Phrygia, Mysia, Galatia, Cappadocia, Cilicia, Coele-Syria, Palestine, Ituraea, and the other provinces of Syria, he imposed heavy contributions on all, and acted as arbiter between kings and cities, — in Cappadocia, for example, between <persName n="43">Ariarathes</persName> and <persName n="537">Sisina</persName>, awarding the kingdom to <persName n="537">Sisina</persName> on account of his mother, <persName n="211">Glaphyra</persName> , who struck him as a beautiful woman. In Syria he delivered the cities from tyrants one after another.

8 1 <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName> came to meet him in Cilicia, and he blamed her for not sharing their labours in avenging <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. Instead of apologising she enumerated to him the things she had done, saying that she had sent the four legions that had been left with her to <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName> forthwith, and that she had another fleet in readiness, but had been prevented from sending it by adverse winds and by the misfortune of <persName n="152">Dolabella</persName>, whose defeat came suddenly; but that she did not lend assistance to <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, who had threatened her twice; that while the war was going on she had set sail for the Adriatic in person with a powerful fleet to assist them, in defiance of <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, and disregarding <persName n="379">Murcus</persName>, who was lying in wait for her; but that a tempest shattered the fleet and prostrated herself with illness, for which reason she was not able to put to sea again till they had already gained her victory. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was amazed at her wit as well as her good looks, and became her captive as though he were a young man, although he was forty years of age. It is said that he was always very susceptible in this way, and that he had fallen in love with her at first sight long ago when she was still a girl and he was serving as master of horse under <persName n="176">Gabinius</persName> at Alexandria.

9 1 Straightway <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s former interest in public affairs began to dwindle. Whatever <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName> ordered was done, regardless of laws, human or divine. While her sister <persName n="50">Arsinoe</persName> was a suppliant in the temple of Artemis Leucophryne at Miletus, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> sent assassins thither and put her to death; and <persName n="517">Serapio</persName>, <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName>'s perfect in Cyprus, who had assisted <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and was now a suppliant at Tyre, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> ordered the Tyrians to deliver to her. He commanded the Aradians to deliver up another suppliant, who when <persName n="440">Ptolemy XIII</persName>, the brother of <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName>, disappeared at the battle with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> on the Nile, said that he was <persName n="440">Ptolemy XIII</persName>, and whom the Arcadians now held. He ordered the priest of Artemis at Ephesus, whom they called the Megabyzus,2 and who had once received <persName n="50">Arsinoe</persName> as queen, to be brought before him, but in response to the supplications of the Ephesians, addressed to <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName> herself, released him. So swiftly was <persName n="27">Antony</persName> transformed, and this passion was the beginning and the end of evils that afterwards befell him. When <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName> returned home <persName n="27">Antony</persName> sent a cavalry force to Palmyra, situated not far from the Euphrates, to plunder it, bringing the trifling accusation against its inhabitants, that being on the frontier between the Romans and the Parthians, they had avoided taking sides between them; for, being merchants, they bring the products of India and Arabia from Persia and dispose of them in the Roman territory; but in fact, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s intention was to enrich his horsemen. However, the Palmyreans were forewarned and they transported their property across the river, and, stationing themselves on the bank, prepared to shoot anybody who should attack them, for they are expert bowmen. The cavalry found nothing in the city. They turned round and came back, having met no foe, and empty-handed.

10 1 It seems that this course on <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s part caused the outbreak of the Parthian war not long afterward, as many of the rulers expelled from Syria had taken refuge with the Parthians. Syria, until the reign of <persName n="21">Antiochus Pius</persName> and his son, <persName n="20">Antiochus IX Cyzicenus</persName>, had been ruled by the descendants of <persName n="513">Seleucus I</persName>, as I have related in my Syrian history. <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> added it to the Roman sway, and <persName n="508">Scaurus</persName> was appointed praetor over it. After <persName n="508">Scaurus</persName> the Senate sent others, including <persName n="176">Gabinius</persName>, who made war against the Alexandrians, and after <persName n="176">Gabinius</persName>, <persName n="133">Crassus</persName>, who lost his life in the Parthian war, and after <persName n="133">Crassus</persName>, <persName n="75">Bibulus</persName>. At the time of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s death and the intestine strife which followed, tyrants had possession of the cities one by one, and they were assisted by the Parthians, who made an irruption into Syria after the disaster to <persName n="133">Crassus</persName> and co-operated with the tyrants. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> drove out the latter, who took refuge in Parthia. He then imposed very heavy tribute on the masses and committed the outrage already mentioned against the Palmyreans, and did not wait for the disturbed country to become quiet, but distributed his army in winter quarters in the provinces, and himself went to Egypt to join <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName>.

11 1 She gave him a magnificent reception, and he spent the winter there without the insignia of his office and with the habit and mode of life of a private person, either because he was in a foreign jurisdiction, in a city under royal sway, or because he regarded his wintering as a festal occasion; for he even laid aside the cares and escort of a general, and wore the square-cut garment of the Greeks instead of the costume of his own country, and the white Attic shoe of the Athenian and Alexandrian priests, which they call the phaecasion. He went out only to the temples, the schools, and the discussions of the learned, and spent his time with Greeks, out of deference to <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName>, to whom his sojourn in Alexandria was wholly devoted.

II
12 1 Such was the state of affairs with <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. As <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was journeying to Rome his illness became acute at Brundusium, and a rumour gained currency that he was dead. On his recovery he returned to the city and showed to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s friends the letters <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had written. The Antonians directed <persName n="92">Calenus</persName> to give <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> the two legions, and wrote to <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName> in Africa to turn that province over to him. This was the course of the Antonians while, as it appeared that <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> had not been guilty of any serious wrong, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> transferred Africa to him in exchange for his former provinces. He also sold the remainder of the property confiscated under the conscriptions. The task of assigning the soldiers to their colonies and dividing the land was one of exceeding difficulty. For the soldiers demanded the cities which had been selected for them before the war as prizes for their valour, and the cities demanded that the whole of Italy should share the burden, or that the cities should cast lots with the other cities, and that those who gave the land should be paid the value of it; and there was no money. They came to Rome in crowds, young and old, women and children, to the forum and temples, uttering lamentations, saying that they had done no wrong for which they, Italians, should be driven from their fields and their hearthstones, like people conquered in war. The Romans mourned and wept with them, especially when they reflected that the war had been waged, and the rewards of victory given, not in behalf of the commonwealth, but against themselves and for a change of the form of government; that the colonies were established to the end that democracy should never again lift its head, — colonies composed of hirelings settled there by the rulers to be in readiness for whatever purpose they might be wanted.

13 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> explained to the cities the necessity of the case, but he knew that it would not satisfy them; and it did not. The soldiers encroached upon their neighbours in an insolent manner, seizing more than had been given to them and choosing the best lands; nor did they cease even when <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> rebuked them and made them numerous other presents, since they were contemptuous of their rulers in the knowledge that they needed them to confirm their power, for the five years' term of the triumvirate was passing away, and army and rulers needed the services of each other for mutual security. The chiefs depended on the soldiers for the continuance of their government, while, for the possession of what they had received, the soldiers depended on the permanence of the government of those who had given it. Believing that they could not keep a firm hold unless the givers had a strong government, they fought for them, from necessity, with good-will. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> made many other gifts to the indigent soldiers, borrowing from the temples for that purpose, for which reason the affections of the army were turned toward him, and the greater thanks were bestowed upon him both as the giver of the land, the cities, the money, and the houses, and as the object of denunciation on the part of the despoiled, and as one who bore this contumely for the army's sake.

14 1 Observing this, <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, the brother of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who was then consul, and <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName>, the wife of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and <persName n="314">Manius</persName>, his procurator during his absence, resorted to artifices to delay the settlement of the colonies till <persName n="27">Antony</persName> should return home, in order that it might not seem to be wholly the work of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and that he might not reap the thanks alone, and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> be bereft of the favour of the soldiers. As this evidently could not be done, on account of the haste of the soldiers, they asked that <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> should take the colony leaders of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s legions from <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s own friends, although the agreement with <persName n="27">Antony</persName> yielded the selection to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> exclusively; they made it a matter of complaint that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was not present. They themselves brought <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s children before the soldiers, and, in terms such as would cause ill feeling, besought them not to forget <persName n="27">Antony</persName> or allow him to be deprived of the glory or the gratitude due to his service to them. The fame of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was then at its height, not only among the soldiers, but among all others. The victory of Philippi was considered wholly due to him, on account of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s illness. Although <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was not ignorant that it was a violation of the agreement, he yielded as a matter of favour to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and appointed friends of the latter as colony leaders for <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s legions. These leaders, in order that they might appear more favourable to the soldiers than <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was, allowed them to commit still greater outrages. So there was another multitude from another group of communities, neighbours of the dispossessed ones, suffering many injuries at the hands of the soldiers, and crying out against <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, saying that the colonisation was worse than the proscription, since the latter was directed against foes, while the former was against unoffending persons.3

15 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> knew that these citizens were suffering injustice, but he was without means to prevent it, for there was no money to pay the value of the land to the cultivators, nor could the rewards to the soldiers be postponed, on account of wars which were still on foot. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> ruled the sea and was reducing the city to famine by cutting off supplies: <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> and <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> were collecting a new fleet and army: the soldiers would be less zealous in the future if they were not paid for their former service. It was a matter of much importance that the five years' term of office was running out, and that the good-will of the soldiers was needed to renew it, for which reason he was willing to overlook for the time being their insolence and arrogance. Once in the theatre when he was present, a soldier, not finding his own seat, went and took one in the place reserved for the knights. The people pointed him out and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had him removed. The soldiers were angry. They gathered around <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> as he was going away from the theatre and demanded their comrade, for, as they did not see him, they thought that he had been put to death. When he was produced before them they supposed that he had been brought from prison, but he denied that he had been imprisoned and related what had taken place. They said that he had been instructed to tell a lie and reproached him for betraying their common interests. Such was the example of their insolence in the theatre.

16 1 Having been called, about that time, to the Campus Martius for a division of the land, they came in haste while it was still night, and they grew angry because <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> delayed his coming. <persName n="385">Nonius</persName>, a centurion, chided them with considerable freedom, urging decent treatment of the commander by the commanded, and saying that the cause of the delay was <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s illness, not any disregard of them. They first jeered at him as a sycophant; then, as the excitement waxed hot on both sides, they reviled him, threw stones at him, and pursued him when he fled. Finally he plunged into the river and they pulled him out and killed him and threw his body into the road where <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was about to pass along. So the friends of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> advised him not to go among them, but to keep out of the way of their mad career. But he went forward, thinking that their madness would be augmented if he did not come. When he saw the body of  the centurion he turned aside. Then, assuming that the crime had been committed by a few, he chided them and advised them to exercise forbearance toward each other hereafter, and proceeded to divide the land. He allowed the meritorious ones to ask for rewards, and he gave to some who were not meritorious, contrary to their expectation. Finally the crowd were confounded; they repented and were ashamed of their importunity; they condemned themselves and asked him to search out and punish the slayers of <persName n="385">Nonius</persName>. He replied that he knew them and would punish them only with their own guilty consciences and the condemnation of their comrades. The soldiers, thus honoured with pardon, rewards, and gifts, changed at once to joyful acclamations.

17 1 Let these two instances out of many serve as examples of the prevailing insubordination. The cause was that the generals, for the most part, as is usually the case in civil wars, were not regularly chosen; that their armies were not drawn from the enrolment according to the custom of the fathers, nor for the benefit of their country; that they did not serve the public so much as they did the individuals who brought them together; and that they served these not by the force of law, but by reason of private promises; not against the common enemy, but against private foes; not against foreigners, but against fellow-citizens, their equals in rank. All these things impaired military discipline, and the soldiers thought that they were not so much serving in the army as lending assistance, by their own favour and judgment, to leaders who needed them for their own personal ends. Desertion, which had formerly been unpardonable, was now actually rewarded with gifts, and whole armies resorted to it, including some illustrious men, who did not consider it desertion to change to a like cause, for all parties were alike, since neither of them could be distinguished as battling against the common enemy of the Roman people. The common pretence of the generals that they were all striving for the good of the country made desertion easy in the thought that one could serve his country in any party. Understanding these facts the generals tolerated this behaviour, for they knew that their authority over their armies depended on donatives rather than on law.

III
18 1 Thus, everything was torn in factions, and the armies indulged in insubordination toward the leaders of the factions, while famine began to afflict Rome, the supplies by sea being cut off by <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, and Italian agriculture ruined by the wars. Whatever food was produced was consumed by the troops. Most of them committed robberies by night in the city. There were acts of violence worse than robbery which went unpunished, and these were supposed to have been committed by soldiers. The people closed their shops and drove the magistrates from their places as though there were no need of courts of justice, or of useful arts, in a city oppressed by hunger and infested with brigands.

19 1 <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, who was a republican and ill affected toward the triumvirate, which seemed not likely to come to an end at the appointed time, fell into controversy, and even graver differences, with <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. He alone received kindly, and promised aid to the agriculturists who had been deprived of their lands and who were now the suppliants of every man of importance; and they promised to carry out his orders. So <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s soldiers, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> also, blamed him for working against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s interests, and <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName> blamed him for stirring up war at an inopportune time, until <persName n="314">Manius</persName> maliciously changed her mind by telling her that as long as Italy remained at peace <persName n="27">Antony</persName> would stay with <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName>, but that if war should break out there he would come back speedily. Then <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName>, moved by a woman's jealousy, incited Lucius to discord. While <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was leading out the last of the colonies she sent the children of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, together with Lucius, to follow him, so that he should not acquire too great éclat with the army by being seen alone. A body of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s cavalry made an expedition to the coast of Bruttium, which <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> was ravaging, and Lucius either thought or pretended to think that it had been sent against himself and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s children. Accordingly, he betook himself to the Antonian colonies to collect a body-guard, and accused <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> to the soldiers as being treacherous to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> replied that everything was on a friendly and harmonious footing between himself and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and that <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> was trying to stir up a war between them for another reason, in that he was working against the triumvirate, by virtue of which the soldiers had a firm hold upon their colonies, and that the cavalry were now in Bruttium executing the triumvirate's orders.

20 1 When the officers of the army learned these facts, they arbitrated between <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> at Teanum and brought them to an agreement on the following terms: That the consuls should exercise their office in the manner of the fathers and not be hindered by the triumvirs; that the land should be assigned only to those who fought at Philippi; that of the money derived from confiscated property, and of the value of that which was still to be sold, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s soldiers in Italy should have an equal share; that neither <persName n="27">Antony</persName> nor <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> should draw soldiers from Italy by conscription hereafter; that two of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s legions should serve with <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> in the campaign against <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>; that the passes of the Alps should be opened to the forces sent by <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> into Spain, and that <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> should not further interfere with them; that <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> should be satisfied with those conditions, should dispense with his body-guard and administer his office fearlessly. Such was the agreement which they made with each other through the influence of the officers of the army. Of these only the two last were carried into effect, <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName> crossing the Alps with him, but unwillingly.

21 1 As the other conditions were not carried into effect, or were delayed, <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> departed to Praeneste, saying that he was in fear of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, who, by virtue of his office, had a guard, while he himself was unprotected. <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName> went there to meet <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, saying now that she had fears for her children. She used him for a pretext this time instead of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. Both of them wrote these things to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and friends were sent to him with the letters, who were to give him particulars about each complaint. Although I have searched, I have not been able to find any clear account of what <persName n="27">Antony</persName> wrote in reply. The officers of the armies bound themselves by an oath to act as umpires again between their magistrates, to decide what was right, and to coerce whichever should refuse to obey the decision; and they summoned Lucius and his friends to attend for this purpose. These refused to come, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> reproached them in invidious terms to the officers of the army and in the presence of the optimates of Rome. The latter hastened to Lucius and implored him to have pity on the city and on Italy, torn by the civil wars, and to consent that by common agreement the decision should rest with themselves or with the officers.

22 1 Although <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> had respect for the speakers and for what they said, <persName n="314">Manius</persName> boldly declared that while <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was doing nothing but collecting money from foreigners, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was, by his favours, preoccupying the affections of the army and the desirable places in Italy; for that defrauding <persName n="27">Antony</persName> he had freed Cisalpine Gaul, which had previously been given to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>; that he had assigned to the soldiers almost the whole of Italy instead of the eighteen cities; that, instead of the twenty-eight legions that had participated in the battle, he had admitted thirty-four to a share of the lands and also of the money from the temples, which he had collected on the pretext of fighting <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, against whom he had done nothing as yet, although the city was oppressed by famine; that he had distributed this money in order to curry favour with the soldiers, to the prejudice of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and that the property of the proscribed had been not so much sold as given to the soldiers outright; and, finally, that if he really wanted peace he should give his account for what he had already done, and for the future do only what should be agreed upon in common. Thus arrogantly did <persName n="314">Manius</persName> proclaim his views, implying that <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> could not do anything by his own authority and that his agreement with <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was of no validity, although it provided that each should have absolute power over the affairs committed to him, and that each should ratify what was done by the other. When <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> saw that they were everywhere preparing for war, each side made similar preparations.

23 1 Two legions of the army which had been colonised at Ancona and which had served under the elder <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> and under <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, hearing of the respective preparations for war, and being moved by friendship for each of them, sent ambassadors to Rome to beseech them both to come to an agreement. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> replied that he was not making war against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, but that <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> was making war against him. The ambassadors then united with the officers of this army in a common embassy to <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> asking him to submit his controversy with <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> to a tribunal; and they made it plain what they would do if he should not accept the decision. Lucius and his friends accepted the proposal, and fixed the place for the trial at Gabii, a city midway between Rome and Praeneste. A council-chamber was prepared for the arbiters, and two platforms for the speakers in the centre, as in a regular trial. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, who arrived first, sent some horsemen along the road by which <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> was to come, in order to find out whether any stratagem was discoverable. These met certain horsemen of <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, either his advance guard or men spying like the others, and as the two parties came into collision killed some of them. <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> retreated, saying that he was afraid of being entrapped, and, although recalled by the officers of the army, who promised to escort him, he could not be persuaded to come again.

24 1 Thus the negotiations came to nothing, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> resolved upon war and issued proclamations even now full of bitterness against each other. The army of Lucius consisted of six legions of infantry, which he commanded by virtue of his consulship, and eleven others belonging to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, which were under the command of <persName n="92">Calenus</persName>; these were all in Italy. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had four legions at Capua and his praetorian cohorts about his person. <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName> was leading six other legions to Spain.5 Lucius had supplies of money from <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s provinces where peace prevailed. But war was raging in all the provinces that had fallen to the lot of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> except Sardinia,6 for which reason he borrowed money from the temples, promising to return it with thanks — from the Capitoline temple at Rome, from those of Antium, of Lanuvium, of Nemus,7 and of Tibur, in which cities there are to‑day the most abundant stores of consecrated money.

25 1 The affairs of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> were in disorder outside of Italy also. For <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, by reason of the proscription, the colonising of the soldiers, and these dissensions with <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, had gained much in reputation and power. Those who feared for their safety, or had been despoiled of their property, or who utterly abhorred the form of government, mostly went and joined him. Young men, also, eager for military service for the sake of gain, who thought that it made no difference under whom they served, since all service was Roman service, rather preferred to join <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> as representing the better cause. He had become rich by sea-robbery and had a numerous fleet and full crews. <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> joined him with two legions of soldiers, 500 archers, a large sum of money, and eighty ships; he also sent for the other army from Cephallenia. Accordingly, some persons think that if <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> had then invaded Italy, which was wasted with famine and civil strife, and was looking for him, he might easily have mastered it.

26 1 But <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> lacked wisdom. His idea was not to invade, but only to defend, and this he did till he failed in that also. In Africa <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName>, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s lieutenant, had just delivered his army, in pursuance of an order from <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, to <persName n="160">Fango</persName>, a lieutenant of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. He was ordered to resume the command, and as <persName n="160">Fango</persName> would not relinquish it he collected a force composed of retired veterans, a miscellaneous crowd of Africans, and auxiliaries of the native princes, and made war on him. <persName n="160">Fango</persName>, having been defeated on both wings and having lost his camp, thought that he had been betrayed, and committed suicide; and <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName> again became master of the two African provinces. <persName n="733">Bocchus</persName>, king of Mauretania, at the instance of <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, made war on <persName n="101">Carinas</persName>, who was <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s procurator in Spain. <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>, who was patrolling the Adriatic with seventy ships, two legions of soldiers, and a force of archers and slingers, light-armed troops and gladiators, devastated the regions subject to the triumvirs. He sailed against Brundusium, captured some of the triremes of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, burned others, shut the inhabitants up in their walls, and plundered their territory.

27 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> sent a legion of soldiers to Brundusium and hastily recalled <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName> from his march to Spain. Both <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> sent recruiting officers throughout Italy, who had skirmishes with each other of more or less importance, and frequent ambuscades. The good-will of the Italians was of great service to Lucius, as they believed that he was fighting for them against the new colonists. Not only the cities that had been designated for the army, but almost the whole of Italy, rose, fearing like treatment. They drove out of the towns, or killed, those who were borrowing money from the temples for <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, manned their walls, and joined Lucius. On the other hand, the colonised soldiers joined <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. Each one in both parties took sides as though this were his own war.

28 1 Though these events were taking place, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> nevertheless convoked the Senate and the equestrian order and addressed them as follows: "I know very well that I am accused by <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> and his friends of weakness and want of courage because I do not fight them, and that I shall be still further accused on account of my calling you together. But I have strong forces who have suffered wrong in common with me, both those who have been dispossessed of their colonies by <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> and the others whom I have in hand; and I am strong in all other respects except only in the purpose to fight. I am not fond of fighting in civil wars except under dire necessity, or of wasting the remainder of our citizens in conflicts with each other; least of all in this civil war, whose horrors will not be announced to us from Macedonia or Thrace, but will take place in Italy itself, which, if it becomes the field of battle, must suffer countless evils in addition to the loss of life. For these reasons I hesitate. And now I do still protest that I do <persName n="27">Antony</persName> no wrong, nor do I suffer any wrong from him, but I beseech you to reason with <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> and his friends on your own account, and to bring them to a reconciliation with me. If you cannot even now persuade them, I shall presently show them that I have hitherto been moved by good-will, not by cowardice; and I ask you to be witnesses for me not only among yourselves, but also to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and to sustain me on account of the arrogance of <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>."

29 1 So spake <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. Thereupon some of his hearers went again to Praeneste. <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> said to them merely, that both sides had already begun hostilities, that <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was practising deception; for he had lately sent a legion to Brundusium to prevent <persName n="27">Antony</persName> from coming home. <persName n="314">Manius</persName> showed also a letter of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s, either true or fictitious, saying that they should fight if anybody assailed his dignity. When the senators asked if anybody had assailed <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s dignity, and urged <persName n="314">Manius</persName> to submit that question to trial, he indulged in many other quibbles till they went away unsuccessful. Nor did they collectively bring any answer to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, either because they had communicated it each for himself, or because they were ashamed, or for some other reason. The war broke out and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> set forth to take part in it, leaving <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> with two legions to guard Rome. Most of the aristocrats then most clearly showed, by joining <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, that they were not pleased with the rule of the triumvirs.

IV
30 1 The following were the principal events of the war. A sedition broke out in two of <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>' legions at Alba, which expelled their commanding officers and began to revolt. Both <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> hastened to them. <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> arrived there first and kept them by a large donative and great promises. While <persName n="175">Furnius</persName> was bringing a reinforcement to <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> fell upon his rearguard. <persName n="175">Furnius</persName> took refuge on a hill and withdrew by night, suspecting an ambush, but the next day he laid siege to Sentia and <persName n="175">Furnius</persName>' camp together. <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, who was hastening toward Rome, sent forward three cohorts, which effected an entrance into the city clandestinely by night. He followed with his main army and some cavalry and gladiators. <persName n="385">Nonius</persName>, who had charge of the gates, admitted him, and handed over to him the forces under his own command. <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> fled to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> made a speech to the citizens, saying that he should visit punishment upon <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> for their lawless rule, and that his brother would voluntarily resign his share of it and accept the consulship, exchanging an unlawful magistracy for a lawful one, a tyranny for the constitution of their fathers.

31 1 All were delighted with this speech, and thought that the government of the triumvirs was already ended. <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> was saluted as imperator by the people. He marched against <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and collected a fresh army from the cities colonized by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s soldiers, and strengthened their fortifications. These colonies were well affected toward <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. <persName n="71">Barbatius</persName>, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s quaestor, who had had some difficulty with him and was returning home for that reason, said, in answer to inquiries, that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was displeased with those who were making war on <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> to the prejudice of their common sway: whereupon some, who were not aware of the deception practised by <persName n="71">Barbatius</persName>, changed sides from <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> put himself in the way of <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName>, who was returning to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> with a large army from Gaul. <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> and <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName>, also <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s generals, were following <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName> to prevent him from advancing. <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName>, who was the closest friend of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, fearing lest <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName> should be surrounded, seized Sutrium, a stronghold very useful to <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, expecting that he would turn <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> from <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName> and draw him upon himself, and that <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName>, who would then be in the rear of <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, would assist him (<persName n="9">Agrippa</persName>). It all turned out as <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> had anticipated. So <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, having failed of his undertaking, marched to join <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> and <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName>. <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName> and <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> harassed him on both sides, watching especially for an opportunity to catch him in the defiles.

32 1 When <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> perceived their design he did not dare to come to an engagement with both of them closing in upon him; so he turned aside to Perusia, a strongly fortified city, and encamped near it, to wait there for <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName>. <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName>, <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName>, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> advanced against him and against Perusia and enclosed them with three armies and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> summoned reinforcements in haste from all directions, as against the vital point of the war, where he had <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> surrounded. He sent others forward to hold in check the forces of <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName>, who were approaching. The latter, however, hesitated on their own account to advance, as they altogether disapproved of the war and did not know what <persName n="27">Antony</persName> thought about it, and on account of mutual rivalry were unwilling to yield to each other the military chieftainship. <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> did not go out to battle with the forces surrounding him, because they were better and more numerous and well drilled, while his were for the most part new levies; nor did he resume his march, since so many enemies were on his flanks. He sent <persName n="314">Manius</persName> to <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName> and <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> to hasten them to the aid of the besieged <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, and he sent <persName n="568">Tisienus</persName> with 4000 horse to pillage the enemy's supplies, in order to force him to raise the siege. <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> entered within the walls of Perusia so that he might winter in a strong place, if necessary, until <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName> and <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> should arrive.

33 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, with all haste and with his whole army, drew a line of palisade and ditch around Perusia fifty-six stades in circuit, on account of the hill on which it was situated; he extended long arms to the Tiber, that nothing might be introduced into the place. <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> on his part built a similar line of countervallation, thus fortifying the foot of the hill. <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName> urged <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName>, <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName>, <persName n="57">Ateius</persName>, and <persName n="92">Calenus</persName> to hasten from Gaul to the assistance of <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, and collected reinforcements, which she sent to <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> under the lead of <persName n="378">Plancus</persName>. <persName n="378">Plancus</persName> destroyed one of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s legions, which was on the march to Rome. While <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> and <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName> were proceeding, at the instance of <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName> and <persName n="314">Manius</persName>, to the relief of <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> (but with hesitation and doubt as to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s intention), in order to raise the blockade, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName>, leaving a guard at Perusia, threw themselves in the way. The former, who had not yet formed a junction with each other and were not proceeding with much alacrity, retreated — <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> to Ravenna and <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName> to Ariminum. <persName n="378">Plancus</persName> took refuge in Spoletium. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> stationed a force in front of each, to prevent them from forming a junction, and returned to Perusia, where he speedily strengthened his investment of the place and doubled the depth and width of his ditch to the dimensions of thirty feet each way. He increased the height of his wall and built 1500 wooden towers on it, sixty feet apart. He had also strong redoubts and every other kind of intrenchment, with double front, to besiege those within and to repel assaults from without. While these works were under construction there were frequent sorties and fights, in which the forces of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had the advantage in the use of missiles, and the gladiators of <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> were better at hand-to‑hand fighting. So these killed many at close quarters.

34 1 When the work of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was finished famine fastened upon <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, and the evil grew more pressing, since neither he nor the city had made preparations beforehand. Knowing this fact <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> kept the most vigilant watch. On the day preceding the Calends of January, <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> thought to avail himself of the holiday, under the belief that the enemy would be off their guard, to make a sally by night against their gates, hoping to break through them and bring in his other forces, of which he had abundance in many places. But the legion that was lying in wait near by, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> himself with some praetorian cohorts, attacked him, and <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, although he fought valiantly, was driven back. About the same time the mass of the people in Rome openly denounced the war and the victory, because the grain was kept under guard for the soldiers. They broke into houses in search of food, and carried off whatever they could find.

35 1 <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName> and his friends, ashamed to look on while <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> was perishing of hunger, all moved to his support, intending to overpower <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s forces surrounding and besieging him. <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> and <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName> went to meet them with still larger forces. Fearing lest they should be surrounded, they diverged to the stronghold of Fulginium, distant 160 stades from Perusia. There <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> besieged them, and they lighted many fires as signals to <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>. <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName> and <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> were of the opinion that they should still go forward and fight, but <persName n="378">Plancus</persName> said that, as they were between <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName>, they had best await events. The opinion of <persName n="378">Plancus</persName> prevailed. Those in Perusia rejoiced when they saw the fires, but when <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName> delayed his coming they conjectured that he, too, was in difficulties, and when the fires ceased they thought that he had been destroyed. <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, oppressed by hunger, again fought a night battle, extending from the first watch till daylight, around the whole circum­vallation; but he failed and was driven back into Perusia. There he took an account of the remaining provisions, and forbade the giving of any to the slaves, and prohibited them from escaping, lest the enemy should gain better knowledge of his desperate situation. The slaves wandered about in crowds, threw themselves upon the ground in the city, and between the city and their forts, and ate grass or green leaves wherever they could find them. Those who died <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> buried in long trenches, lest, if he burned them, the enemy should discover what was taking place, and, if they were unburied, disease should result from the poisonous exhalations.

36 1 As no end of the famine, or of the deaths, could be discerned, the soldiers became restive under the condition of affairs, and implored <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> to make another attempt upon the enemy's works, believing that they could break through them completely. He approved of their ardour, saying, "In our recent battle we did not fight in a way corresponding to our present necessity. Now we must either surrender, or, if that seems worse than death, we must fight to the death." All assented eagerly, and, in order that no one should have the night for an excuse, they demanded to be led out by daylight. <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> marched out at dawn. He took an abundance of iron tools, for wall fighting, and ladders of every form. He carried machines for filling the ditches, and folding towers from which planks could be let down to the walls; also all kinds of missiles and stones, and wickerwork to be thrown upon the palisades. They made a violent assault, filled up the ditch, scaled the palisades, and advanced to the walls, which some of them undermined, while others applied the ladders, and others simultaneously moved up the towers and defended themselves with stones, arrows, and leaden balls, with absolute contempt of death. This was done at many different places, and the enemy being drawn in many different directions made a more feeble resistance.8

37 1 The planks having been thrown upon the walls at some places, the struggle became very hazardous, for the forces of <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> fighting on the bridges were exposed to missiles and javelins on every side. They forced their way, nevertheless, and a few leaped over the wall. Others followed, and they would speedily have accomplished something in their desperation, had not the fact become known to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> that they had not many such machines, so that the best of his reserves were brought fresh to the assistance of the tired men. These troops now flung the assailants down from the walls, broke their machines in pieces, and hurled missiles upon them contemptuously (fearing them no longer) from above. Their enemy, although their shields and bodies were pierced and even their cries had failed, held their ground bravely. When the corpses of those who had been killed on the wall were stripped and thrown down among them, they could not bear the indignity, but turned away from the spectacle and stood for a moment undecided, like athletes taking a breathing-spell in the gymnastic games. <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> had pity on them in this condition and sounded a retreat. Then the troops of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> joyfully clashed their arms as for a victory, whereupon those of <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> were roused to anger and again seized their ladders (although they had no more towers), and carried them to the walls with desperation. Yet they did not do any harm to the enemy, for they had not the strength. <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> ran among them and besought them to sacrifice their lives no longer, and led them back groaning and reluctant.

38 1 This was the end of this hotly contested siege. In order that the enemy might not make another attempt on his works, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> stationed a part of his army, that was held in reserve, alongside the fortifications, and instructed others in other places to leap upon the wall at the sound of the trumpet. Although no one urged them on, they went through this exercise continually, in order to become familiar with it, and to inspire the enemy with fear. The troops of <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> began to grow down-hearted, and, as usually happens in such cases, the guards relaxed their vigilance, and thus desertion became more frequent, not only of the common soldiers, but, in some cases, of the higher officers also. And now <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> inclined toward peace, out of pity for the perishing multitude, but the fears of some of the enemies of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> for their own safety still restrained him. But as <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was observed to treat the deserters kindly, and the desire for peace increased among all, <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> began to fear lest, if he refused, he should be delivered up.

V
39 1 Accordingly, having made a sort of test which gave him satisfactory encouragement, <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> called his army together and spoke as follows: "It was my intention, fellow-soldiers, to restore the republic to you when I saw that the government of the triumvirs was a tyranny, which was established, indeed, on the pretext of combating <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, but was not relaxed after their death. <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> had been deprived of his share of the government, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was far away collecting money, and this one man was managing everything according to his own will, and the ancient system of Roman government was only a pretence and a laughing-stock. With the intention of reverting to the freedom and democratic government of our ancestors, I asked that after the rewards of victory had been distributed the monarchy should be dissolved. When my request was not granted, I sought to enforce it by virtue of my office. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> falsely accused me, before the army, of obstructing the colonies out of pity for the landowners. I was ignorant of this slander for a long time, and even when I learned of it I did not suppose that anybody would believe it, when one saw that the colony officers were men assigned by my very self to divide the lands among you. But the calumny misled some people, who joined <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> in order to make war against you, as they think. But eventually they will find that they have been warring against their own interests. I affirm that you have chosen the better cause, and that you have suffered for it beyond your strength. We are vanquished, not by our enemies, but by hunger, to which we have been left a prey by our own generals. It would be becoming in me to fight to the last extremity for my country. Such an end would set a halo of fame upon my high purposes. To the destiny I do not submit, for the sake of you, whom I prefer to my own fame. I will send to the conqueror and beg that he will inflict such punishment as he chooses upon me alone, in place of all of you; that he will grant amnesty, not to me, but to you, his fellow-citizens and formerly his soldiers, who are not now in the wrong, who are not fighting without good cause, and are vanquished, not by war, but by hunger."

40 1 After speaking thus he at once selected three men from the optimates for this mission. The multitude wept, some on their own account, some on account of their general, who appeared to them to have been actuated by the most excellent and democratic purpose, and who now yielded to extreme necessity. The three envoys, when admitted to the presence of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, reminded him that the soldiers on both sides were all of one race, and that they had made campaigns together. They called to mind the friendship of the nobility on either side and also the virtue of their ancestors, who did not allow their differences to become irreconcilable. They advanced other like arguments which were calculated to prevail with him. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, knowing that some of the enemy were still raw recruits, while others were veteran colonists, replied artfully that he would grant amnesty to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s soldiers out of regard for him, but that the others must surrender at discretion. This he said in the presence of all, but, taking aside <persName n="175">Furnius</persName>, one of the three, he led him to expect mild treatment for <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> and the rest, except his own personal enemies.

41 1 These personal enemies of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, having learned of <persName n="175">Furnius</persName>' private interview and suspecting that it related to themselves, reproached him when he came back, and demanded of <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> either that he should ask a new treaty, which should include all alike, or fight to the death, saying that this had not been a private war for any individual, but a public one in behalf of their country. <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> approved, pitying them as men of the same rank as himself, and said that he would send another embassy. Then he added that no one was better fitted for this task than himself, and went immediately without a herald, merely preceded by some persons who went in advance to announce to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> his coming. The latter at once advanced to meet him. There they saw each other surrounded by their friends and conspicuous by the standards and military equipment of generals on either side. Then <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, dismissing9 his friends, went forward with two lictors only, showing his state of mind by his outward appearance. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> understood and imitated his example, showing his intended good-will toward <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>. When he saw the latter hastening to pass inside his fortification, indicating thereby that he had already surrendered, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> anticipated him and went outside the fortification in order that <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> might still be free to consult and decide concerning his own interests. Thus as they moved forward they foreshadowed their intentions to each other in advance, by their retinue and their outward appearance.

42 1 When they came to the ditch they saluted each other, and <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> said: "If I had been a foreigner waging war against you, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, I should consider it disgraceful to be vanquished in this way and still more disgraceful to surrender, and I should have for myself an easy means of deliverance from such humiliation. But since I have been contending with a countryman, my equal in rank, on behalf of our country, I do not consider it disgraceful to be beaten in such a cause by such a man. This I say not to deprecate any suffering that you may choose to inflict upon me (for you see that I have come to your camp without any guarantee), but to ask for others such pardon as may be just, and conducive to your own interests. That I may make this clear to you it is necessary to separate their cause from mine, so that, when you know that I am the only one to blame, you may visit your wrath upon me, and not think that I have come here to bandy words (for that would be inopportune), but to tell the truth, for it is not in my power to speak otherwise.

43 1 "I undertook this war against you, not in order to succeed to the leadership by destroying you but to restore to the country the patrician government which had been subverted by the triumvirate, as not even yourself will deny. For when you created the triumvirate you acknowledged that it was not in accordance with the law, but you established it as something necessary and temporary because <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> were still alive and you could not be reconciled to them. When they, who had been the head of the faction, were dead, and the remainder, if there were any left, were bearing arms, not against the state, but because they feared you, and moreover the five years' term was running out, I demanded that the magistracies should be revived in accordance with the custom of our fathers, not even preferring my brother to my country, but hoping to persuade him to assent upon his return and hastening to bring this about during my own term of office. If you had begun this reform you alone would have reaped the glory. Since I was not able to persuade you, I thought to march against the city and to use force, being a citizen, a nobleman, and a consul. These are the causes of the war I waged and these alone: not my brother, nor <persName n="314">Manius</persName>, nor <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName>, nor the colonization of those who fought at Philippi, nor pity for the cultivators for those who were deprived of their holdings, since I myself appointed the leaders of colonies to my brother's legions who deprived the cultivators of their possessions and divided them among the soldiers. Yet you brought this charge against me before the soldiers, shifting the cause of the war from yourself to the land distribution, and in this way chiefly you drew them to your side and overcame me, for they were persuaded that I was warring against them, and that they were defending themselves against my wrong-doing. You certainly needed to use artifice while you were waging war. Now that you have conquered, if you are the enemy of the country you must consider me your enemy also, since I wished what I thought was for her advantage, but was prevented by famine from accomplishing it.

44 1 "While I say these things I surrender myself to you, as I have already declared, to do with me whatever you wish. I came here alone merely to show what I have thought of you before the war, during the war, and at this moment. So much for myself. Concerning my friends and my whole army if you will not discredit my words, I will give you some advice for your own best interests, and that is, that you inflict no severity up them on account of the quarrel between you and me. As you are a mortal and in the hands of fortune, which is always fickle, do not deter those who might be willing to incur danger for you in hazardous or trying times hereafter, by teaching them that under your rule there is no hope of safety except for the victors. Even if all advice from an enemy is suspected or untrustworthy, I do not hesitate to implore you not to punish my friends for my fault and my ill fortune, but to put the whole punishment on me, who am alone to blame. I purposely left my friends behind so that I might not seem, by using these words in their presence, to be securing favour for myself in an underhand way."

45 1 After <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> had thus spoken he relapsed into silence, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> said: "When I saw you, <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, approaching without any guarantee I hastened to meet you while you were still outside my entrenchments, so that you might even now be master of your own counsels and be able to say or do whatever you should think best for your own interests. Since you deliver yourself to me (as is customary to those who acknowledge that they are in the wrong), it is not necessary that I should discuss the false accusations that you have brought against me with so much art. You began by injuring me and you continue to do so. If you were here negotiating a treaty, you would be dealing with a victor whom you had wronged. Now that you surrender yourself and your friends and your army without conditions, you take away not only all resentment, but also the power which, under negotiations for a treaty, you would necessarily have given me. There is involved in this question not only what you and your friends ought to suffer, but what it is becoming in me, as a just man, to do. I shall make the latter my chief consideration on account of the gods, on my account, and on yours, <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, and I shall not disappoint the expectation with which you came to me."

These things they said to each other, as nearly as it is possible to gather the meaning of the speakers from the memoirs and translate it into our language.10 They then separated, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> praised and admired <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> because he had said nothing impolite or inconsiderate (as is usual in adversity), and <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> praised <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> for his mildness and brevity of speech. The others gathered the meaning of what had been said from the countenances of the two parties.

46 1 <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> sent tribunes to receive the watchword for the army from <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and they took the army roll to him, as it is customary for the tribune who asks for the watchword to deliver to the commander the daily register of the number of troops present. After they had received the watchword they still kept their outposts on duty, for <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> himself ordered that each army should keep its own guard that night, and the next morning <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> offered sacrifice, and <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> sent his soldiers to him bearing their arms, but prepared for marching. They saluted <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> as imperator while still at some distance, and each legion took its separate position as <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had directed, the colonized veterans being apart from the new levies. When <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had finished the sacrifice he took his seat in front of the tribunal, crowned with laurel, the symbol of victory, and ordered them all to lay down their arms where they stood. When they had done so he ordered the veterans to draw nearer, intending, it seems, to reproach them for their ingratitude and to strike terror into them. It was known beforehand what he was about to do, and his own army, either purposely (as soldiers are often advised beforehand), or moved by sympathy for their own relatives, broke from the formation in which they had been placed, crowded around <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>' men as they approached their former fellow-soldiers, embraced them, wept with them, and implored <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> in their behalf, and ceased not crying out and embracing them, the new levies sharing in the outburst of feeling, so that it was impossible to distinguish or discriminate between them.

47 1 For this reason <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> did not persist in his intention, but, after appeasing the tumult with difficulty, addressed his own men as follows: "You have always behaved in such a way to me, fellow-soldiers, that you can ask nothing from me in vain. I think that the new levies served <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> under compulsion, but I intended to ask these old soldiers, who have often served with us and who are now saved from punishment by you, what they have suffered at our hands, or what favour they have asked in vain, or what greater favours they expected from anybody else that they have taken up arms against me, against you, against themselves. For all the trouble I have met with has grown out of the division of the lands, in which they had their share. And now if you will permit me I will yet ask them these questions." They would not allow him to do so, but continued their beseeching. "I grant what you wish," he said. "Let them be dismissed without punishment for their wrong-doing, provided they will hereafter be like-minded with you." They promised on both sides with acclamations and thanks to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, who allowed some of his own men to entertain some of their men as guests. He ordered the remainder to pitch their tents where they had been stationed, at a certain distance from the others, until he should assign them towns for winter quarters and appoint persons to lead them thither.

48 1 Then, seated on his tribunal, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> summoned from Perusia <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> and the Romans of responsibility who were with him. Many of the senators and knights came down, all presenting a pitiful appearance by reason of their sudden change of fortune. As soon as they passed out of Perusia a guard was stationed around it. When they reached the tribunal <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> placed <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> by his own side. Of the rest, some were taken in charge by the friends of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, others by centurions, all of whom had been instructed beforehand to show them honour and to keep watch upon them unobserved. He commanded the Perusians who stretched out their hands to him from the walls, to come forward, all except their town council, and as they presented themselves he pardoned them; but the councillors were thrown into prison and soon afterwards put to death, except <persName n="274">Lucius Aemilius</persName>, who had sat as a judge at Rome in the trial of the murderers of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, who had voted openly for condemnation, and had advised all the others to do the same in order to expiate the guilt.

49 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> intended to turn Perusia itself over to the soldiers for plunder, but <persName n="108">Cestius</persName>, one of the citizens, who was somewhat out of his mind, who had fought in Macedonia and for that reason called himself the Macedonian, set fire to his house and plunged into the flames, and a strong wind fanned the conflagration and drove it over the whole of Perusia, which was entirely consumed, except the temple of Vulcan. Such was the end of Perusia, a city renowned for its antiquity and importance. It is said that it was one of the first twelve cities built by the Etruscans in Italy in the olden time. For this reason the worship of Juno prevailed there, as among the Etruscans generally. But thereafter those who shared among themselves the remains of the city took Vulcan for their tutelary deity instead of Juno. On the following day <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> made peace with all of them, but the soldiers did not desist from tumults against some of them until the latter were killed. These were the chief personal enemies of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, namely, <persName n="98">Cannutius</persName>, <persName n="190">Gaius Flavius</persName>, <persName n="118">Clodius Bithynicus</persName>, and others. Such was the conclusion of the siege of <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> in Perusia, and thus came to an end a war which had promised to be long-continued and most grievous to Italy.

VI
50 1 For <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName>, <persName n="378">Plancus</persName>, <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName>, <persName n="248">Crassus</persName>, <persName n="57">Ateius</persName>, and the others of that party, who had forces not to be despised, numbering about thirteen legions of disciplined troops and upward of 6500 horse, considering Lucius to have been the chief actor in the war, retired to the sea-coast by various routes, some to Brundusium, some to Ravenna, some to Tarentum, some to <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> and <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>, and still others to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. The friends of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> followed them, offering terms of peace, and, when they refused, harassing especially the infantry. From among them only two legions, belonging to <persName n="378">Plancus</persName>, who were intercepted at Cameria, were persuaded by <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> to desert to him. <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName> also fled with her children to Dicaearchia,11 and thence to Brundusium, with 3000 horse, who were sent with her by the generals as an escort. At Brundusium there were five war-ships which had been sent from Macedonia, and she embarked and put to sea, accompanied by <persName n="378">Plancus</persName>, who abandoned the remains of his army through cowardice. These soldiers chose <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName> as their commander. <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> drew over <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> to the side of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. Both <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> and <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName> wrote these facts to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and they prepared landing-places, in expectation of his early arrival, and stores of provisions throughout Italy.

51 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was planning to get possession of another considerable army belonging to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, that was under the command of <persName n="92">Calenus</persName> near the alps. He already had suspicions of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and he hoped, if the latter remained friendly, to preserve these forces for him, or, if war should break out, to add this large force to his own strength. While he was still delaying and looking around for a fair-seeming occasion, <persName n="92">Calenus</persName> died; and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, believing that he had found a good excuse for both transactions, went and took possession of the army and of Gaul and Spain besides, which were also <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s provinces. <persName n="170">Fufius</persName>, the son of <persName n="92">Calenus</persName>, was terrified, and delivered everything over to him without a fight.

<persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, having acquired eleven legions of soldiers and these large provinces by one stroke, dismissed the chief officers from their commands, substituted his own, and returned to Rome. 52 1 As it was still winter, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> retained the deputies of the colonized veterans, who had been sent to him, and still concealed his intentions. In the spring he set out from Alexandria and proceeded by land to Tyre, and thence by sea, touching at Cyprus and Rhodes, to the province of Asia. There he learned of the doings at Perusia and he blamed his brother <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> and <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName>, and, most of all, <persName n="314">Manius</persName>. He found <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName> at Athens, whither she had fled from Brundusium. His mother, <persName n="246">Julia Antonia</persName>, who had fled to <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, had been sent thither by him from Sicily with warships, and escorted by some of the optimates of his party, by <persName n="297">Lucius Libo</persName>, his father-in‑law, by <persName n="504">Saturninus</persName> and others, who, being attracted by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s capacity for great deeds, sought to bring him into friendly relations with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> and to form an alliance between them against <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> replied that he thanked <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> for sending his mother and that he would requite him for the service in due time; that if there should be a war with <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> he would ally himself with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, but that if <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> should adhere to their agreements he would endeavour to reconcile him with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>.

53 1 Such was his answer, and when <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> returned from Gaul to Rome he heard about those who had set sail for Athens. Not knowing exactly what answer <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had given them, he began to excite the colonized soldiers against the latter, representing that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> intended to bring back <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> with the owners of the lands which the soldiers now held, for most of the owners had taken refuge with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. Although this cause of irritation was plausible, the soldiers would not even then take up arms against <persName n="27">Antony</persName> with any zeal, so popular had he become by the reputation he had gained at Philippi. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> considered himself likely to be far superior to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, and <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> in the number of troops, as he now had more than forty legions, but as he had not one ship and no time to make any, while they had 500, he feared lest they should bring famine upon Italy by patrolling the coast. While meditating on those things, and while proposals had been made to him about many girls in marriage, he wrote to <persName n="313">Maecenas</persName> to make an engagement for him with <persName n="512">Scribonia</persName>, the sister of <persName n="297">Lucius Libo</persName>, the father-in‑law of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, so that he might have the means of coming to an arrangement with the latter if need be. When <persName n="297">Lucius Libo</persName> heard of this he wrote to his family that they should betroth her to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> without hesitation. Then <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, on various pretexts, sent away to this place and that, such of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s friends and soldiers as he could not trust, and he sent <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> to Africa, the province assigned to him, and with him the six of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s legions who were most under suspicion.

54 1 Then he summoned <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> to his presence and praised him for his attachment to his brother, because he had taken the blame upon himself while carrying out <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s wishes, but reproached him with ingratitude, if, after meeting such a favour from himself, he should now refuse to make confession regarding <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who was said to have formed an alliance openly with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. "Having confidence in you," he said, "when <persName n="92">Calenus</persName> died I took charge of his provinces and army through my friends for <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, so that they might not be without a head, but now that the plot is unveiled I shall keep them all for myself, and if you wish to go to your brother I will allow you to do so fearlessly." He spoke thus, either to test Lucius or in order that what he said might reach <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> replied in the same spirit as before, saying, "I knew that <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName> was in favour of the monarchy, but I joined with her and made use of my brother's soldiers to overthrow all of you. And now if my brother should come to dissolve the monarchy I will go to join him, either openly or secretly, and will fight you again in behalf of the country, although you have been a benefactor to me. But if he seeks allies to assist him in maintaining the tyranny, I will fight on your side against him as long as I think that you, too, are not trying to establish a monarchy. For I shall always set my country above gratitude and above family." So spake <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, holding him in the same admiration as recently at Perusia, said that he did not wish to incite him against his brother, but that he would entrust to <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, because he was what he was, the whole of Spain, and the army in it, with <persName n="533">Sextus Peducaeus</persName> and <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName>, who now commanded it, as his lieutenants.12

Thus <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> dismissed <persName n="277">Lucius Antonius</persName> with honour, but kept a secret watch upon him by means of his lieutenants. 55 1 <persName n="27">Antony</persName> left <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName> ill at Sicyon, and set sail from Corcyra into the Adriatic with an inconsiderable army and 200 ships that he had built in Asia. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> learned that <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> was coming to meet him with a fleet and a large number of soldiers. Then some of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s friends thought that it was not safe to trust even to the agreement exchanged between them, since <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> had been condemned at the trial of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s murderers, and after the condemnation had been placed on the list of the proscribed, and had fought against <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> in the campaign of Philippi. Nevertheless, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> advanced with five of his best ships in order to seem to have confidence in <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>, and he ordered the others to follow at a certain distance. When <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> was observed coming forward, rowing swiftly, with his whole army and fleet, <persName n="378">Plancus</persName>, who was standing by the side of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, was alarmed and advised him to check his course and send a few men forward to make a test, as to a man whose intentions were doubtful. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> replied that he would rather die by a breach of the treaty than be saved by an appearance of cowardice, and continued his course. Now they were drawing near, and the vessels which bore the chiefs were distinguishable by their ensigns and approached each other. <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s first lictor, who stood in the bows as was customary, either forgetful that <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> was a man of doubtful purpose, and that he too was leading his own forces, or moved by a lofty spirit as though he were meeting subject or inferior men, ordered them to lower their flag. They did so, and laid their ship alongside of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s. When the two commanders saw each other they exchanged greetings, and the army of <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> saluted <persName n="27">Antony</persName> as imperator. <persName n="378">Plancus</persName> recovered his courage with difficulty. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> received <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> in his own ship and sailed to Paloeis, where <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> had his infantry, and here he yielded his tent to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>.

56 1 From thence they sailed to Brundusium, which was garrisoned by five cohorts of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s troops. The citizens closed their gates against <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>, as an old enemy, and against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, as one introducing an enemy. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was indignant, and considering this a pretence, and that he was in fact shut out by <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s garrison at the latter's instance, he drew a ditch and palisade across the isthmus that connects the town with the mainland. The city is situated on a peninsula which fronts a crescent-shaped harbour, and the people coming from the mainland could no longer reach the rising ground on which the city stands, as it had been cut off and walled in. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> also surrounded the harbour, which is large, and the islands in it, with towers planted closely together. He sent forces along the coasts of Italy, whom he ordered to seize the advantageous positions. He called upon <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> also to move against Italy with his fleet and do whatever he could. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, with alacrity, despatched <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> with a numerous fleet and four legions of soldiers, who seized Sardinia, which belonged to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and two legions in it, who were panic-stricken at this agreement between <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. In Italy <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s men captured the town of Sipuntum of Ausonia. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> besieged Thurii and Consentia and ravaged their territory with his cavalry.

57 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, attacked so suddenly and in so many places, sent <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> into Ausonia to succour the distressed inhabitants. <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> called out the colonized veterans along the road, and they followed at a certain interval, supposing that they were moving against <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, but when they learned that what was happening was at <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s instance, they turned around and went back secretly. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was greatly alarmed by this. Nevertheless, while marching to Brundusium with another army he again fell in with the colonized veterans, and interceded with them, and prevailed upon those who had been colonized by himself to follow him. They were ashamed to refuse, but they had the secret intention to bring <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> into harmony with each other, and if <persName n="27">Antony</persName> should refuse and go to war, then to defend <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. The latter was detained some days at Canusium by sickness. Although his forces considerably outnumbered those of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, he found Brundusium walled in, and he could do nothing but encamp alongside of it and await events.

58 1 <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was enabled by means of his entrenchments to defend himself easily, although he was much inferior in numbers, and he summoned his army from Macedonia in haste, and in the meantime resorted to the stratagem of sending war-ships and merchant vessels to sea by night secretly with a multitude of private citizens on board, who returned, in batches, the next day, in sight of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, fully armed, as though they had just come from Macedonia. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had his machines already prepared and was about to attack the Brundusians, to the great chagrin of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, since he was not able to defend them. But toward evening the news reached both armies that <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> had captured Sipuntum and that <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> had been repulsed from Thurii, but was still besieging Consentia. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was disturbed by this news. When it was announced that <persName n="521">Servilius</persName> was coming to the assistance of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> with 1500 horse, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> could not restrain his rage, but sprang up from supper, and, with such friends as he could find ready and with 400 horse, he pressed forward with the utmost intrepidity, and fell upon the 1500, who were still asleep near the town of Hyria, threw them into a panic, captured them without a fight, and returned to Brundusium the same day. Thus did the reputation that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had gained at Philippi as invincible still inspire terror.

59 1 <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s praetorian cohorts, proud of his prestige, approached the camp of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> in groups and reproached their former comrades for coming hither to fight <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, to whom they all owed their safety at Philippi. When the latter replied that the others had come making war against themselves, they fell to arguing and brought charges against each other. <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s men said that Brundusium had been closed against him and that <persName n="92">Calenus</persName>' troops had been taken from him, the others spoke of the investment and siege of Brundusium, the invasion of Southern Italy, the agreement with <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>, one of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>'s murderers, and the treaty with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, their common enemy. Finally <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s men revealed their purpose to the others, saying that they had come with <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, not because they were forgetful of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s merits, but with the intention of bringing them to an agreement, or, if <persName n="27">Antony</persName> refused and continued the war, of defending <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> against him. These things they openly said also when they approached <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s works.

While these events were in progress the news came that <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName> was dead. It was said that she was dispirited by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s reproaches and fell sick, and it was thought that she had become a willing victim of disease on account of the anger of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who had left her while she was sick and had not visited her even when he was going away. The death of this turbulent woman, who had stirred up so disastrous a war on account of her jealousy of <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName>, seemed extremely fortunate to both of the parties who were rid of her. Nevertheless, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was much saddened by this event because he considered himself in some sense the cause of it.

VII
60 1 There was a certain <persName n="291">Lucius Cocceius</persName>, a friend of both, who had been sent, in company with <persName n="86">Caecina</persName>, by <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, the previous summer, to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> in Phoenicia, and had remained with <persName n="27">Antony</persName> after <persName n="86">Caecina</persName> returned. This <persName n="291">Lucius Cocceius</persName>, seizing his opportunity, pretended that he had been sent for by <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> for the purpose of a friendly greeting. When <persName n="27">Antony</persName> allowed him to go he asked, by way of testing his disposition, whether <persName n="27">Antony</persName> would like to write any letter to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> making use of himself as his messenger. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> replied: "What can we write to each other, now that we are enemies, except mutual recrimination? I wrote letters in reply to his of some time ago, which I sent by the hand of <persName n="86">Caecina</persName>. Take copies of those if you like." This he said by way of jest, but <persName n="291">Lucius Cocceius</persName> would not yet allow him to call <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> an enemy after his generous behaviour towards Lucius and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s other friends. But <persName n="27">Antony</persName> replied: "He has shut me out of Brundusium and taken my provinces and the army of <persName n="92">Calenus</persName> from me. He is kind only to my friends, and evidently not to keep them friendly, but to make them enemies to me by his benefactions." <persName n="291">Lucius Cocceius</persName>, after hearing these complaints, did not care to irritate further a naturally passionate disposition, but proceeded to make his visit to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>.

61 1 When <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> saw him he expressed astonishment that he had not come sooner. "I did not save your brother," he exclaimed, "in order that you should be my enemy."13 <persName n="291">Lucius Cocceius</persName> replied, "How is it that you, who make friends out of enemies, call your friends enemies and take from them their armies and provinces?" "It was not fitting," replied <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, "that after the death of <persName n="92">Calenus</persName> such large resources should be left in the hands of such a stripling as <persName n="92">Calenus</persName>' son while <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was still far distant. Lucius was excited to frenzy by them and <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> and <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>, who were near by, were about to use them against us. So, too, I took sudden possession of the legions of <persName n="378">Plancus</persName>, in order that they might not join the Pompeians. His cavalry has actually gone to Sicily." "These matters have been told differently," said <persName n="291">Lucius Cocceius</persName>; "but even <persName n="27">Antony</persName> did not credit the statements made to him until he was shut out of Brundusium as an enemy." "I gave no order on that subject," replied <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, "for I did not know beforehand that he was coming, nor did I anticipate that he would come here with enemies. The Brundusians themselves and the praefect, who had been left with them on account of the raids of <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>, of their own motion excluded <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who was in league with the common enemy, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, and was bringing in <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>, one of my father's murderers, who had been condemned by vote of the Senate, by judgment of the court, and by the proscription, who besieged Brundusium after the battle of Philippi, and is still blockading the Adriatic coast, who has burned my ships and plundered Italy."

62 1 But it was agreed between you," said <persName n="291">Lucius Cocceius</persName>, "that you might treat with whomsoever you chose. Yet <persName n="27">Antony</persName> has not made a treaty with any of the murderers, and he holds your father in no less honour than you do. <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> was not one of the murderers, but the vote was cast against him on account of personal animosity, for he had no share whatever in the plots of those days. If we consider him unpardonable because he was a friend of <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, are we not in a fair way to be bitter against almost everybody? <persName n="27">Antony</persName> made an agreement with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, not to make an aggressive war with him, but either to secure his help in case of an attack by you, or to bring him into good relations with you, since even he has done nothing which should make him irreconcilable. You are the one to blame for these things, for if there had been no war in Italy those men would not have ventured to send ambassadors to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>." <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> repeated his accusations, saying, "<persName n="314">Manius</persName> and <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName> and Lucius brought war against Italy, and against me as well as Italy; and <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, who did not attack before, now makes descents upon the coast, encouraged by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>." Cocceius replied, "Not encouraged by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, but directed by him; for I will not conceal from you the fact that the rest of Italy, which is destitute of naval defences, will be attacked by a powerful fleet unless you two agree to peace." <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, who gave due weight to this artful suggestion, reflected a moment, and then said, "But <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> will have the worst of it. He has just been repulsed from Thurii as he deserves." Then <persName n="291">Lucius Cocceius</persName>, having gone over the whole controversy, led the conversation up to the death of <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName> and the manner of it, saying that she fell sick because she could not bear the anger of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and wasted away with grief because he would not see her even when she was ill, and that he was in a manner the cause of his wife's death. "Now that she is dead," he continued, "it only remains for you to tell each other frankly what your suspicions are."

63 1 In this way <persName n="291">Lucius Cocceius</persName> won the confidence of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and passed the day as his guest, and begged him to write to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> as the younger man to the older. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> said that he would not write to one who was still waging war against him, because <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had not written to him, but that he would make complaint to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s mother, because, although a relative and held in the highest honour by <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, she had fled from Italy, as though she could not have obtained everything from him as from her own son. This was his device also for opening a correspondence by writing to <persName n="246">Julia Antonia</persName>. As <persName n="291">Lucius Cocceius</persName> was going away from the camp many of the higher officers advised him of the purpose of the army, and he communicated this and other things he had learned to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, so that he might know that they would fight against him because he did not come to an agreement. So he advised <persName n="27">Antony</persName> that <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> should be called back from his ravaging to Sicily, and that <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> should be sent somewhither until the treaty of peace should be made. <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s mother besought him to the same purpose, for she belonged to the xxxxx clan. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> apprehended that if the negotiations should fail he would be put to the shame of calling on <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>  for assistance again, but his mother encouraged him to believe that they would not fail, and <persName n="291">Lucius Cocceius</persName> informed her, intimating that he knew more than he had told. So <persName n="27">Antony</persName> yielded, and ordered <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> back to Sicily, implying that he would take care of their mutual concerns, and sent <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> away as governor of Bithynia.

64 1 When <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s soldiers learned these facts they chose deputies and sent the same ones to both commanders. They took no notice of accusations because they had been chosen, not to decide a controversy, but to restore peace. <persName n="291">Lucius Cocceius</persName> was added to their number as a friend of both, together with <persName n="55">Asinius Pollio</persName> from <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s party and <persName n="313">Maecenas</persName> from that of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. It was determined that there should be amnesty between <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> for the past and friendship for the future. Moreover, as <persName n="187">Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor</persName>, the husband of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s sister <persName n="388">Octavia</persName>, had recently died, the umpires decided that her brother should betroth her to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, which he did immediately. Then <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> embraced each other. Thereupon shouts went up from the soldiers and congratulations were offered to each of the generals, without intermission, through the entire day and night.

65 1 Now <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> made a fresh partition of the whole Roman empire between themselves, the boundary line being Scodra, a city of Illyria which was supposed to be situated about midway up the Adriatic gulf. All provinces and islands east of this place, as far as the river Euphrates, were to belong to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and all west of it to the ocean to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> was to govern Africa, inasmuch as <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had given it to him. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was to make war against <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> unless they should come to some agreement, and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was to make war against the Parthians to avenge their treachery toward <persName n="133">Crassus</persName>. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was to make the same agreement with <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had already made. Both of them might freely enlist soldiers in Italy in equal numbers.

These were the last conditions of peace between <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. Straightway each of them sent his friends to attend to urgent business. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> despatched <persName n="458">Publius Ventidius Bassus</persName> to Asia against the Parthians and against <persName n="253">Labienus</persName>, the son of <persName n="251">Labienus</persName>, who, with the Parthians, had made a hostile incursion into Syria and had advanced as far as Ionia during the late troubles.

What <persName n="253">Labienus</persName> and the Parthians did and suffered I will show in my Parthian history; 66 1 but in the meantime <persName n="228">Helenus</persName>, a lieutenant of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, who had repossessed Sardinia by a sudden onset, was driven out again by <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName>, the lieutenant of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was so exasperated by this that he rejected <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s endeavours to bring him to an agreement with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. They proceeded to Rome together and celebrated the marriage. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> put <persName n="314">Manius</persName> to death because he had excited <persName n="172">Fulvia</persName> by his accusations against <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName> and had been the cause of so many evils. He also revealed to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> the fact that <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName>, who was in command of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s army on the Rhone, had had the intention of deserting him, and had sent word to that effect to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> while he was besieging Brundusium. This secret <persName n="27">Antony</persName> revealed not with universal approbation, but because of his real frankness and eagerness to show his good-will. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> instantly summoned <persName n="501">Salvidienus</persName> to Rome pretending that he had some private communication to make to him, and that he should send him back to the army. When he came <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> confronted him with proofs of his treachery and put him to death, and gave his army to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, as he considered it untrustworthy.

VIII
67 1 Now famine fell upon Rome, since the merchants of the Orient could not put to sea for fear of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, who controlled Sicily, and those of the west were deterred by Sardinia and Corsica, which the lieutenants of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> held, while those of Africa opposite were prevented by the same hostile fleets, which infested both shores. Thus there was a great rise in the cost of provisions, and the people considered the cause of it to be the strife between the chiefs, and cried out against them and urged them to make peace with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. As <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> would by no means yield, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> advised him to hasten the war on account of the scarcity. As there was no money for this purpose, an edict was published that the owners of slaves should pay a tax for each one, equal to one-half of the twenty-five drachmas that had been ordained for the war against <persName n="81">Brutus</persName> and <persName n="606">Cassius</persName>, and that those who acquired property by legacies should contribute a share thereof. The people tore down the edict with fury. They were exasperated that, after exhausting the public treasury, stripping the provinces, burdening Italy itself with contributions, taxes, and confiscations, not for foreign war, not for extending the empire, but for private enmities and to add to their own power (for which reason the proscriptions and murders and this terrible famine had come about), the triumvirs should deprive them of the remainder of their property.

They banded together, with loud cries, and stoned those who did not join them, and threatened to plunder and burn their houses, 68 1 until the whole populace was aroused, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> with his friends and a few attendants came into the forum intending to intercede with the people and to show the unreasonableness of their complaints. As soon as he made his appearance they stoned him unmercifully, and they were not ashamed when they saw him enduring this treatment patiently, and offering himself to it, and even bleeding from wounds. When <persName n="27">Antony</persName> learned what was going on he came with haste to his assistance. When the people saw him coming down the Via Sacra they did not throw stones at him, since he was in favour of a treaty with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, but they told him to go away. When he refused to do so they stoned him also. He called in a larger force of troops, who were outside the walls. As the people would not allow him even so to pass through, the soldiers divided right and left on either side of the street and the forum, and made their attack from the narrow lane, striking down those whom they met. The people could no longer find ready escape on account of the crowd, nor was there any way out of the forum. There was a scene of slaughter and wounds, while shrieks and groans sounded from the housetops. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> made his way into the forum with difficulty, and snatched <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> from the most manifest danger, in which he then was, and brought him safe to his house. The mob having been dispersed, the corpses were thrown into the river in order to avoid their gruesome appearance. It was a fresh cause of lamentation to see them floating down the stream, and the soldiers stripping them, and certain miscreants, as well as the soldiers, carrying off the clothing of the better class as their own property. This insurrection was suppressed, but with terror and hatred for the triumvirs; the famine grew worse; the people groaned, but did not stir.

69 1 <persName n="27">Antony</persName> suggested to the relatives of <persName n="297">Lucius Libo</persName> that they should summon him from Sicily for the purpose of congratulating his brother-in‑law,14 and to accomplish something more important; and he himself promised him a safe-conduct. His relatives wrote promptly and <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> acquiesced. <persName n="297">Lucius Libo</persName>, on his arrival, cast anchor at the isle of Pithecusa, which is now called Aenaria.15 When the people learned this, they assembled together again and besought <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> with tears to send letters of safeguard to <persName n="297">Lucius Libo</persName>, who desired to negotiate with him for peace. He did so reluctantly. The people also, threatening to burn <persName n="375">Mucia</persName>, the mother of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, with her house, sent her to communicate with her son in the interest of peace. When <persName n="297">Lucius Libo</persName> perceived that his enemies were on the point of yielding, he demanded that the leaders themselves should come together in order to make such concessions to each other as they could agree upon. The people compelled them to this course, and, accordingly, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> went to Baiae.

70 1 All the friends of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> urged him with one accord to make peace, except <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName>, who wrote to him from Sardinia either to prosecute the war vigorously or still to procrastinate, because famine was fighting for them, and he would thus get better terms if he should decide to make peace. <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> also advised him to distrust <persName n="379">Murcus</persName>, who opposed these views, intimating that he was seeking power for himself. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, who had been vexed with <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> lately on account of his high position and his stubbornness, became still more averse to him for this reason, and held no communication with him whatever, until, finally, <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> retired in disgust to Syracuse. Here he saw some of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>'s guards following him, and he expressed his opinion of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> to them freely. Then <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> bribed a tribune and a centurion of <persName n="379">Murcus</persName>, and sent them to kill him and to say that he had been murdered by slaves. To give credibility to this falsehood he crucified the slaves. But he did not succeed in concealing this crime, — the next one committed by him after the murder of <persName n="422">Pompeius Bithynicus</persName>, — <persName n="379">Murcus</persName> having been a man distinguished for his warlike deeds, who had been strongly attached to that party from the beginning, and had rendered great assistance to <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> himself in Spain, and had joined him in Sicily voluntarily.

71 1 Such was the death of <persName n="379">Murcus</persName>. His other friends urged <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> to make peace, and they accused <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> of fondness of power and as opposing peace not so much from good-will to his master as from a desire to command an army and a province. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> yielded and set sail for Aenaria with a large number of his best ships, having embarked himself on a magnificent one with six banks of oars. In this style, toward evening, he sailed proudly past Puteoli in sight of his enemies. Early in the morning two sets of piles were driven in the sea a short distance apart, and planks were placed upon them. Upon the platform nearest the shore <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> took their places, while <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> and <persName n="297">Lucius Libo</persName> occupied a seaward one, a small space of water separating them, so that they could hear each other without shouting. As <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>  thought that he had come in order to be admitted to a share of the government in place of <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, while the others would concede nothing but his recall from exile, they separated for the time without accomplishing anything. Nevertheless, negotiations were continued on the part of friends, who advanced various proposals from one side to the other. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> demanded that, of the proscripts and the men with him, those who had participated in the murder of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> should be allowed a safe place of exile, and the rest restoration to their homes and citizenship, and that the property they had lost should be restored to them. Urged on by the famine and by the people to an agreement, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> reluctantly conceded a fourth part of this property, promising to buy it from the present holders. They wrote to this effect to the proscripts themselves, hoping that this would satisfy them. The latter accepted all the terms, for they already had apprehensions of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> on account of his crime against <persName n="379">Murcus</persName>. So they gathered around <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>  and besought him to come to an agreement. Then <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>  rent his garments, declaring that he was betrayed by those for whom he had fought, and he frequently invoked the name of <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> as one most competent to command and his only friend.

72 1 Finally, at the instance of his mother, <persName n="375">Mucia</persName>, and <persName n="246">Julia Antonia</persName>, again the three men (<persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>) came together on the mole of Puteoli, washed by the waves on both sides, and with ships moored round it as guards. Here they came to an agreement on the following terms: That the war between them should cease at once both on land and sea, and that commerce should be everywhere unmolested; that <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> should remove his garrisons from Italy and no longer afford a refuge to fugitive slaves; that he should not blockade with his fleet the Ionian coast, but should govern Sardinia, Sicily, and Corsica, and any other islands then in his possession, as long as <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> should hold sway over the other countries; that he should send to Rome the corn that had been long since required as tribute from those islands, and that he might have Peloponnesus in addition: that he might hold the consulship in his absence through any friend he might choose, and be inscribed as a member of the Augurs' College. Such were the conditions accorded to <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> himself; while the nobles who were still in exile were allowed to return, except those who had been condemned by vote of the Senate and judgment of the court for participation in the murder of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. The property of the rest, who had fled merely from fear, and whose goods had been seized by violence, was all to be restored except movables, but proscripts were to receive a fourth part of theirs. Slaves who had served in the army of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> were to be free, and free persons who had thus served should, upon their discharge, receive the same rewards as those who had served under <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName>.

73 1 Such were the terms of the treaty, to which they attached their names and seals and sent it to Rome to be placed in the custody of the Vestal virgins. Then they entertained each other, casting lots to determine the order of the ceremony. The first banquet took place on <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>' six-banked ship, moored alongside the mole. On succeeding days <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> gave banquets, they too on the mole, in tents, on the pretext that thus all might participate, but perhaps really for their better security and to quiet apprehensions: for they did not even then neglect precautions. Their ships were moored alongside and guards were stationed around them, and the banqueters were girded with concealed daggers. It is said that, while the three were feasting in the ship, <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> sent a message to <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> advising him to entrap these men and avenge the wrongs of his father and his brother, and to avail himself of this most favourable occasion to resume the sway that his father had exercised, saying that he, with his own ships, would take care that nobody should escape; but that <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> replied, in a manner worthy of his family and his position, "Would that <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> had done this without my knowledge." False swearing, that is, might suit <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName>, but not <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. At this banquet the daughter of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> and granddaughter of <persName n="297">Lucius Libo</persName> was betrothed to <persName n="316">Marcellus</persName>, the stepson of <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and nephew of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. On the following day they designated the consuls for the next four years, for the first year <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="297">Lucius Libo</persName>, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> being privileged to substitute whomsoever he liked in his own place; next <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>; next <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName> and <persName n="541">Sosius</persName>; and, finally, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> again; and as they would then have been consuls the third time it was expected that they would then restore the government to the people.

74 1 Having finished this business they separated, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> going to Sicily by sea, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> to Rome by land. When the Romans and Italians learned the news there was universal rejoicing at the return of peace and at their deliverance from intestine war, from the conscription of their sons, from the arrogance of guards, from the running away of slaves, from the pillage of fields, from the ruin of agriculture, and, above all, from the famine that had pressed upon them with the greatest severity. So, as the triumvirs were proceeding on their journey sacrifices were offered in their honour as to saviours. The city would have given them a magnificent reception, had they not entered secretly by night in order to avoid jealousies. The only people disappointed were those to whom had been allotted lands belonging to men who were to be restored with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. They thought that they should have irreconcilable enemies dwelling alongside of them as landlords, who would do them injury whenever they could. The exiles who were with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, all but a few, took leave of him at Puteoli and set sail for Rome. Their coming was to the people a new source of joy and acclamations, so great a number of illustrious men having been unexpectedly saved from death.

75 1 After these events <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> set forth on an expedition to Gaul, which was in a disturbed state, and <persName n="27">Antony</persName> started for the war against the Parthians. The Senate having voted to ratify all that he had done or should do, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> again despatched his lieutenants in all directions and arranged everything else as he wished. He set up kings here and there as he pleased, on condition of their paying a prescribed tribute: in Pontus, <persName n="142">Darius</persName>, the son of <persName n="407">Pharnaces</persName> and grandson of <persName n="373">Mithridates</persName>: in Idumea and Samaria, <persName n="231">Herod</persName>: in Pisidia, <persName n="18">Amyntas</persName>; in a part of Cilicia, <persName n="420">Polemocratia</persName>, and others in other countries. Desiring to enrich as well as to exercise the soldiers, who were to go with him into winter quarters, he sent some of them against the Partheni, an Illyrian tribe near Epidamnus, who had been very much attached to <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>; others against the Dardani, another Illyrian tribe, who were for ever making incursions into Macedonia. Others he ordered to remain in Epirus, in order to have them all round him, as he intended to pass the winter himself in Athens. He sent <persName n="175">Furnius</persName> to Africa to bring four legions, that were under the command of <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName>, for service against the Parthians. He did not know as yet that <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> had deprived <persName n="574">Titus Sextius</persName> of the command of these troops.

76 1 Having made these dispositions, he spent the winter at Athens with <persName n="388">Octavia</persName> just as he had spent the previous one at Alexandria with <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName>, merely looking over the reports sent from the army, exchanging the display of a commander for the simplicity of private life, wearing the square-cut pallium and the Attic shoe, and with no crowd at his doors. He went out, in like manner, without the insignia of office, accompanied by two friends and two attendants, to the discussions and lectures of the public teachers. He took his meals in the Greek fashion, passed his leisure time with Greeks, and enjoyed their festivals in company with <persName n="388">Octavia</persName>, with whom he was very much in love, being by nature excessively fond of women. At the end of the winter he was like another man. He changed his clothing, and with his clothing his whole appearance. There was straightway a crowd around his doors composed of lictors, army officers, guards, and all things that inspire terror and awe. Embassies were received which had previously been kept waiting by his orders, lawsuits were decided, ships were launched, and all other preparations for the campaign were put in motion.

IX
77 1 While <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was thus occupied the treaty existing between <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> was broken for other reasons, as was suspected, than those avowed by <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, which were the following: <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had ceded the Peloponnesus to <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> on condition that the tribute then due from the Peloponnesians should either be given over at once, or that it should be guaranteed by <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, or that <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> should wait till the collection had been made. But <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> had not accepted it on these conditions. He thought that it had been given him with the amount of tribute then due. Vexed, as <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> said, whether at this state of things, or from his general faithlessness, or his jealousy because the others had large armies, or because <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> had prompted him to consider the agreement as a truce rather than a lasting peace, he began to build ships and recruit crews, and once harangued his soldiers, telling them they must be prepared for everything. Mysterious robbery again infested the sea; and there was little or no relief from the famine among the Romans, who cried out that the treaty had brought no deliverance from their sufferings, but only a fourth partner to the tyranny. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> having caught certain pirates and put them to torture, they said that <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> had sent them out, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> proclaimed this to the people and wrote it to <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> himself, who disavowed it and made a counter complaint respecting the Peloponnesus.

78 1 Those of the nobility who were still with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, seeing him always under the influence of his freedmen, bribed some of them, either for their own purposes or to gratify <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, to incite their master against <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName>, who was still governing Corsica and Sardinia. The freedmen, for their part, did this gladly, because they were envious of the power of <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName>. In this way <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> was brought to an estrangement with <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName>, and about the same time Philadelphus, a freedman of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, made a voyage to <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> to procure corn, and <persName n="367">Micylio</persName>, the closest friend of <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName>, visited <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> to arrange for the desertion of <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName>. The latter promised to hand over to him Sardinia, Corsica, three legions of soldiers, and a large number of light-armed troops. Whether this was the work of Philadelphus, or was a consequence of the calumnies against <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName>, which <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> had listened to, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> accepted the offer, not immediately, but soon, since he considered the peace broken in fact. He invited <persName n="27">Antony</persName> to come from Athens and meet him at Brundusium on an appointed day, in order to take counsel with him about this war. At the same time he brought war-ships from Ravenna and an army from Gaul, and the remainder of his apparatus, rapidly to Brundusium and Puteoli, intending to sail from both sides of Italy to Sicily if <persName n="27">Antony</persName> should agree in opinion with him.

79 1 <persName n="27">Antony</persName> came at the appointed day with a small escort, but not finding <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> there he did not wait, either because he did not approve of the war, considering it a violation of the treaty, or because he observed <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s great preparations (for the desire to be the sole ruler did not permit their fears to slumber at any time), or because he was alarmed by a prodigy. It was found that one of the guards who slept around his tent had been devoured by wild beasts except his face only, as though this had been left for the purpose of recognition, and that he had uttered no cry, nor did any of those who were asleep with him know of it. The Brundusians said that a wolf had been seen just before daybreak running away from the tents. Nevertheless <persName n="27">Antony</persName> wrote to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> not to violate the treaty, and he threatened <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> with punishment as his own fugitive slave; for he had been the slave of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, whose property <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had bought when it was sold under the law of war.

80 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> sent officers to receive Sardinia and Corsica, which <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> turned over to them. He strengthened the Italian coast with numerous towers to prevent <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> from raiding it again. He ordered the building of new triremes at Rome and Ravenna, and he sent for a large army from Illyria. When <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> came he made the latter a free citizen instead of a freedman, and put him in command, under the admiral <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName>, of the ships which he had brought with him. When he had finished these preparations and brought together a still larger amount of war material he yet delayed, and he reproached <persName n="27">Antony</persName> for not waiting. He ordered <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> to bring with him to Tarentum everything that was now in readiness. While <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> was making the voyage a storm overtook him which destroyed only the admiral's ship, which had been built for <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> himself. This was considered an omen of what was to take place. As the belief still prevailed that this war was a violation of the treaty, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> sought to dispel the suspicion. He wrote to the city and he told his soldiers that <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> had violated the treaty by encouraging piracy, that the pirates had confessed this, that <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> had revealed the whole design, and that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> knew it, and for that reason had refused to give up the Peloponnesus.

81 1 When all things were in readiness he set sail for Sicily, going himself from Tarentum, while <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName>, and <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> sailed from Etruria. The infantry was sent on the march to Rhegium and great haste was displayed in all quarters. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> had scarcely heard of the desertion of <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> when <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was already moving against him. While the hostile fleets were advancing from both sides, he awaited the attack of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> at Messana, and ordered <persName n="355">Menecrates</persName>, who of all his freedmen was the bitterest enemy of <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName>, to advance against <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName> and <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> with a large fleet. This <persName n="355">Menecrates</persName> then was observed by his enemies near nightfall on the open sea. They retired into the bay near Cumae, where they passed the night, <persName n="355">Menecrates</persName> proceeding to Aenaria. At day-break they drew up their fleet, in the form of a crescent, as close to the shore as possible, in order to prevent the enemy breaking through them. <persName n="355">Menecrates</persName> again showed himself, and immediately came on with a rush. As his enemies would not advance to the open sea, and he could do nothing of importance there, he made a charge in order to drive them upon the land. They beached their ships and fought back against the attacking prows. <persName n="355">Menecrates</persName> had the opportunity to draw off and renew the attack as he pleased, and to bring up fresh ships by turns, while the enemy were distressed by the rocks, on which they had grounded, and by the inability to move. They were like land forces contending against sea forces, unable either to pursue or retreat.

82 1 In this situation <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> and <persName n="355">Menecrates</persName> came in sight of each other; and, abandoning the rest of the fight, drove at once against each other with fury and shouting, as though they had staked the issue of the battle on this encounter, whichever should be the victor. Their ships came into violent collision and were badly damaged, <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> losing his prow and <persName n="355">Menecrates</persName> his oar-blades. Grappling-irons were thrown by both, and the ships, being fastened together, could no longer manoeuvre, but the men, as in a battle on land, failed not in deeds of valour. Showers of javelins, stones, and arrows were discharged, and bridges for boarding were thrown from one ship to the other. As the ship of <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> was higher than the other his bridges made a better passage-way for those who ventured on them, and his missiles were more effective for the same reason. Many men were already slain, and the remainder wounded, when <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> was pierced in the arm with a dart, which was, however, drawn out. <persName n="355">Menecrates</persName> was struck in the thigh with a Spanish javelin, made wholly of iron with numerous barbs, which could not be readily extracted. Although <persName n="355">Menecrates</persName> could no longer take part in the fight, he remained there all the same, encouraging the others, until his ship was captured, when he plunged into the depths of the sea. <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> towed the captured ship to the land, but was able to do nothing more himself.

83 1 Thus had fared the left wing of the naval fight. <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName> directed his course from the right to the left and cut off some of <persName n="355">Menecrates</persName>' ships from the main body, and when they fled pursued them to the open sea. <persName n="150">Demochares</persName>, who was a fellow-freedman of <persName n="355">Menecrates</persName> and his lieutenant, fell upon the remainder of <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName>' ships, put some of them to flight, broke others in pieces on the rocks, and set fire to them after the crews had abandoned them. Finally <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName>, returning from the pursuit, led back his own retreating ships and prevented the burning of any more. As night approached all rested in their stations of the previous night.

Such was the end of this naval fight, in which the forces of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> had much the best of it; but <persName n="150">Demochares</persName>, grieving over the death of <persName n="355">Menecrates</persName> as the greatest possible defeat (for those two, <persName n="355">Menecrates</persName> and <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName>, had been the foremost of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>' sea-captains) abandoned everything and sailed for Sicily immediately, as though he had lost not merely the body of <persName n="355">Menecrates</persName> and one ship, but his whole fleet.

84 1 <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName>, as long as he expected that <persName n="150">Demochares</persName> would renew his attack, remained at his station, unable to fight in the open sea, for his best ships had been destroyed and the others were unfit for battle. When he learned that his antagonist had gone to Sicily, he repaired his ships and coasted along the shore exploring the bays. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, in the meantime, proceeded from Tarentum to Rhegium, with a large fleet and army, and near Messana came up with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, who had forty ships only. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s friends advised him to improve this most favourable opportunity and attack <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> with his great fleet, while the latter had so few ships and before the rest of his naval force should arrive. He did not follow this advice, but waited for <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName>, saying that it was not good policy to run a risk when he was expecting reinforcements.

When <persName n="150">Demochares</persName> arrived at Messana, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> appointed him and <persName n="30">Apollophanes</persName>, another of his freedmen, admirals in place of <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> and <persName n="355">Menecrates</persName>; 85 1 and when <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> heard of his disaster at Cumae he sailed out of the straits to meet <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName>. After accomplishing the greater part of the distance, and while he was passing Stylis and turning into Scyllaeum, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> darted out of Messana and fell upon his rear, pushed on to his front, attacked him all along the line, and challenged him to fight. Although beset in this way, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s fleet did not give battle, since <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> forbade it, either because he feared to fight in the straits or because he adhered to his first determination not to fight without <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName>. By his orders, however, all hugged the shore, rode at anchor, and defended themselves with their prows toward the enemy. <persName n="150">Demochares</persName>, by setting two of his ships by turns against one of the enemy's, threw them into confusion. They dashed against the rocks and against each other, and began to fill with water. And so these ships were lost, like those at Cumae, without striking a blow, being stuck fast and battered by the enemy, who had freedom of movement to advance and retreat.

86 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> leaped from his ship upon the rocks and pulled out of the water those who swam ashore, and conducted them to the mountain above. However, <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> and the other generals who were there, encouraged each other, cut loose from their anchors without awaiting orders, and put to sea against the enemy, thinking that it was better to be conquered fighting than to fall unresisting before the blows of their assailants. First, with wonderful audacity, <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> rammed the flag-ship of <persName n="150">Demochares</persName> and captured it. <persName n="150">Demochares</persName> leaped upon another vessel. Then, while the struggle and carnage were in progress, <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName> and <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> hove in sight, advancing from the open sea, although they had not been observed by <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s men either from the land or the water. The Pompeians, being farther out at sea, beheld them first, and, when they saw them, retreated, for darkness was approaching, and fatigued as they were, they dared not encounter fresh men.

This conjuncture happened very opportunely for those who had just now been in difficulties; 87 1 but at nightfall, those who had reached the shore from the ships took refuge on the mountains and lighted numerous fires as signals to those who were still on the sea, and there passed the night without food, uncared for, and in want of everything. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> fared like the rest, and moved around exhorting them to endure their privations till morning. While he was undergoing these hardships it was not known that <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName> had arrived, nor could anything needful be obtained from the ships busied as they were with their wrecks. But good luck came to them from another quarter. The thirteenth legion was approaching by way of the mountains, and, learning of the disaster and judging of their route by the fire, they made their way through the crags. They found their commander, and those who had taken refuge with him, suffering from fatigue and want of food, and ministered to them, dividing the work, some caring for some, others for others. The centurions brought their commander into an improvised tent, as none of his body-servants were present, these having been dispersed in the darkness and disorder. He sent messengers in all directions forthwith, to announce that he was safe, and he learned that <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName> had arrived with the vanguard of his fleet; and, in view of these two helpful and unexpected events, he allowed himself some rest.

X
88 1 The next morning, when <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> looked out upon the water, he beheld some of his ships burned, others partly burned, others still burning, and others broken in pieces; and the sea filled with sails, rudders, and tackle, while, of the ships that were saved, the greater part were damaged. Having ranged the fleet of <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName> in front, he made repairs on those of his vessels that most needed them, canting them, the enemy meantime remaining quiet, either because they feared <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName>, or because they had decided to attack again in the open sea. Thus they remained on either side until midday, when a south wind burst upon them, raising violent billows in that surging and confined channel. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> was then inside the harbour of Messana. The ships of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> were again shattered on the rough and inhospitable coast, dashing against the rocks and against each other, for, as they were not fully manned, they were not under good control.

89 1 <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName>, apprehending that this rising storm would increase in violence, moved farther seaward and rode at anchor: here, on account of the depth of water, the waves were less boisterous; and even here he had recourse to hard rowing to avoid being driven ashore, some of the others following his example, but most of them, thinking that the wind would soon subside, as it usually does in the springtime, moored themselves with anchors at either end, landward and seaward, pushing each other off with poles. As the wind grew more violent everything was thrown into confusion. The ships collided, broke their anchors, and were thrown quivering on the shore or against one another. Cries of alarm and groans of pain were mingled together, and exhortations that fell upon deaf ears. Orders could not be heard, and there was no distinction between pilot and common sailor, knowledge and authority being alike unavailing. The same destruction awaited those in the ships and those who fell overboard, the latter being crushed by wind, waves, and floating timber. The sea was full of sails, spars, and men, living and dead. Those who sought to escape by swimming to land were dashed against the rocks by the surf. When the convulsion seized the water,16 as is usual in that strait, they were terrified, being unaccustomed to it, and then their vessels were whirled around and dashed against each other worse than ever. As night came on the wind increased in fury, so that they perished no longer in the light but in the darkness.

90 1 Groans were heard throughout the entire night, and the cries of men running along the shore and calling their friends and relatives upon the sea by name, and mourning for them as lost when they could hear no responses; and anon the cries of others lifting their heads above the waves and beseeching aid from those on shore. Nothing could be done on either land or water. Not only was the sea inexorable to those engulfed in it, as well as to those still in the ships, but the danger was almost as great on land as at sea, lest the surf should dash them against the rocks. So distressed were they by this unexampled tempest that those who were nearest the land feared the land, yet could not get sufficient offing to avoid collision with each other, for the narrowness of the place and its naturally difficult outlet, together with the force of the waves, the rotary motion of the wind, caused by the surrounding mountains, and the whirlpool of the deep, holding everything in its grasp, allowed neither tarrying nor escape. The darkness of a very black night added to their distress. And so they perished, no longer even seeing each other, some uttering confused cries, others yielding in silence, accepting their doom, some even hastening it, believing that they were irretrievably doomed. The disaster so far surpassed their experience that it bereft them of the hope of saving themselves even by chance. Finally, at the approach of daylight, the wind suddenly relaxed its force, and after sunrise wholly died away; yet even then, although the storm had ceased, the surges rolled a long time. The fury of the tempest surpassed the memory of the oldest inhabitants. It was altogether unexampled, and the greater part of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s ships and men were destroyed by it.

91 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, who had lost heavily in the battle the previous day and had sustained two severe calamities together, took the road in haste to Vibo that same night, by way of the mountains, being unable to repair this disaster, for which there was no help at hand. He wrote to all his friends and generals to be on the alert lest a plot should be formed against him here or there, as is liable to be the case when adversity comes. He despatched the infantry he had with him to all points on the Italian coast, lest <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> should be emboldened by his good luck even to invade the mainland. But the latter had no thought of an expedition by land. He did not even attack the ships that were left from the wreck, nor those that went away after the storm had subsided. On the contrary, he paid no attention to the enemy while they were frapping their ships with ropes as well as they could, and sailing with a favourable wind to Vibo. He neglected them either because he thought that the disaster was all-sufficient for him, or because he did not know how to follow up a victory, or, as I have said elsewhere, because he was altogether inefficient in attack and determined only to defend himself against assailants.

92 1 Less than half of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s ships were saved, and these badly damaged. He left certain officers in charge of them and proceeded to Campania much cast down, for he had no other ships and he needed many; nor did he have time to build them, pressed as he was by famine and by the people, who were again harassing him about a new treaty and mocking at the war as being in violation of the old one. He needed money, but had none. The Romans were not paying the taxes, nor would they allow the use of the revenues that he had devised. But he was always clever at discovering what was for his advantage. He sent <persName n="313">Maecenas</persName> to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> to change the mind of the latter respecting the things about which they had lately had some bickering, and to bring him to an alliance. If <persName n="313">Maecenas</persName> should not succeed, he intended to embark his infantry on merchant vessels, cross over to Sicily, abandon the sea, and wage war on land. While in this state of dejection the news reached him that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had agreed to the alliance, and he heard of a splendid victory over the Gauls of Aquitania, gained under the leadership of <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName>.17 His friends and certain cities also promised him ships, and built them.

Accordingly, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> cast off his despondency, and made more formidable preparations than his previous ones. 93 1 At the beginning of spring, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> set sail from Athens to Tarentum with 300 ships to assist <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> as he had promised. But the latter had changed his mind and postponed his movement until his own ships should be finished. When called upon again and told that <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s forces were ready and sufficient, he advanced other reasons for delay. It was evident that he was again offended with <persName n="27">Antony</persName> about something, or that he disdained his assistance because his own resources were abundant. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was vexed, but he remained, nevertheless, and communicated with <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> again, because the expense of his fleet was burdensome. Moreover, he needed Italian soldiers for his war against the Parthians, and he contemplated exchanging his fleet for a part of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s army; for, although it was provided in their treaty that each of them might recruit soldiers in Italy, it would be difficult for him to do so when Italy had fallen to the lot of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. Accordingly, <persName n="388">Octavia</persName> betook herself to her brother to act as mediator between them. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> complained that he had been abandoned by <persName n="27">Antony</persName> when he was overtaken by danger in the straits; she replied that that had been explained through <persName n="313">Maecenas</persName>. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> said that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had sent his freedman <persName n="93">Callias</persName> to <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> in Africa to induce the latter to make an alliance against him; she replied that she knew that <persName n="93">Callias</persName> had been sent to make arrangements about a marriage, because <persName n="27">Antony</persName> desired, before setting out on his Parthian expedition, to marry his daughter to the son of <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, as had been agreed. After <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had made this statement <persName n="27">Antony</persName> sent <persName n="93">Callias</persName> to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> with permission to put him to the question. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> would not receive him, but said that he would go and have an interview with <persName n="27">Antony</persName> between Metapontum and Tarentum, at a place where there is the river whence the town is named18 between them.

94 1 They both chanced to reach the river at the same time. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> sprang down from his chariot and leaped alone into one of the skiffs moored near by, and rowed toward <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, showing confidence in him as a friend. When <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> saw this he followed the example. So they met in the stream and contended with each other which of them should disembark on the other's bank. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> prevailed because he was going to make a visit to <persName n="388">Octavia</persName> at Tarentum. He took a seat with <persName n="27">Antony</persName> in the latter's chariot, and proceeded to his lodgings at Tarentum unprotected, and passed the night there without guards. On the following day <persName n="27">Antony</persName> made the same exhibition of trust. Thus they were continually changing from suspicion born of rivalry to confidence due to their mutual needs.

95 1 However, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> postponed his expedition against <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> till the following year. On account of the Parthian war <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was not able to wait. Nevertheless, they made an exchange with each other, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> giving to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> 120 ships, which he sent at once and delivered at Tarentum, in return for which <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> promised to send him 20,000 Italian legionaries. <persName n="388">Octavia</persName>, begging the favour from <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, made her brother a present of ten three-banked phaseli — a combination of war-ship and merchant vessel — and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> gave her in return 1000 picked men as a body-guard, to be selected by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. As the term of the triumvirate voted to them was about expiring, they renewed it for five years without again asking the people. And so they separated, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> proceeding straightway to Syria and leaving <persName n="388">Octavia</persName> with her brother, and also a daughter already born to them.

96 1 But <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName>, — either because he was a turn-coat by nature, or because he feared the former threat of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, who had said that he would punish him as a rebellious slave, or because he had received less consideration than he had expected, or because the other freedmen of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> were continually reproaching him for unfaithfulness to his master and urging him to return, — now that <persName n="355">Menecrates</persName> was dead, asked forgiveness, and, having obtained it, deserted to <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> with seven ships, without the knowledge of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s admiral, <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName>. For this reason <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> dismissed the latter from his command and appointed <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> in his place.

When the fleet was ready, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> performed a lustration for it in the following manner. The altars are erected on the margin of the sea, and the multitude ranged around them in a circle of ships, observing the most profound silence. The priests who perform the ceremony offer the sacrifice while standing at the water's edge, and carry the expiatory offerings in skiffs three times round the fleet, the generals sailing with them, beseeching the gods to turn the bad omens against the victims instead of the fleet. Then, dividing the entrails, they cast a part of them into the sea, and put the remainder on the altars and burn them, while the multitude chant in unison. In this way the Romans perform lustrations of the fleet.

XI
97 1 It was intended that <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> should set sail from Puteoli, <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> from Africa, and <persName n="553">Taurus</persName> from Tarentum, against Sicily, in order to surround the enemy at once, from the east, the west, and the south. The day of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s sailing had been previously communicated to all; it was the tenth day after the summer solstice. This, in the Roman calendar, was the calends of the month which, in honour of the first <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, they call July instead of Quintilis. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> fixed on this day, perhaps because he considered it propitious on account of his father, who was always victorious. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> stationed <persName n="417">Plenius</persName> at Lilybaeum with one legion and a considerable body of light-armed troops, to oppose <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>. He guarded the whole coast of Sicily, both east and west, and especially the islands of Lipara and Cossyra, lest they should become convenient harbours and naval stations, the one for <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> the other for <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> against Sicily. The best part of his naval force he kept together at Messana watching its chances.

98 1 In this way they made their preparations on either side, and when the calends came they all set sail at daybreak, <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> from Africa with 1000 ships of burden, seventy war vessels, twelve legions of soldiers, 500 Numidian horse, and a great quantity of apparatus; <persName n="553">Taurus</persName> from Tarentum with only 102 of the 130 ships that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had left, since the oarsmen of the remainder had perished during the winter. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> sailed from Puteoli, offering sacrifices and pouring out libations from the admiral's ship into the water to the propitious winds, and to Saviour Neptune, and to Waveless Ocean, that they should be his allies against his father's enemies. Certain ships sent in advance made examination of the bays, and <persName n="32">Appius Claudius</persName> with a large squadron followed as a rear guard. On the third day after their departure a south wind blew with violence and capsized a large number of ships of burden belonging to <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>. Nevertheless, he reached the Sicilian coast, laid siege to <persName n="417">Plenius</persName> in Lilybaeum, and got possession of some towns by persuasion and others by force. When the wind began to blow <persName n="553">Taurus</persName> returned to Tarentum. While <persName n="32">Appius Claudius</persName> was doubling the promontory of Minerva, some of his ships were shattered against the rocks, others ran with violence on the shoals, and the rest were dispersed, not without injury. At the beginning of the storm, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> took refuge in the sheltered bay of Elea, except one six-banked ship, which was wrecked on the promontory. The south wind was succeeded by a south-wester, which threw the bay into commotion, as it opened toward the west. It was impossible to sail out of the bay with the wind still ahead, nor could the ships be held by oars or anchors. They crashed against each other or against the rocks, and by night confusion became worse confounded.

99 1 When the tempest had subsided, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> buried the dead, cared for the wounded, clothed those who had swum ashore and furnished them with new weapons, and repaired his whole fleet with the means at his command. Six of his heavy ships, twenty-six lighter ones, and a still larger number of liburnian galleys had been destroyed. He was likely to consume nearly thirty days in these parts; and now the end of summer was approaching, for which reason he deemed it best to postpone the war till the following summer, but as the people were suffering from scarcity he drew his ships upon the land and made his preparations rapidly, and sent the crews of the ships he had lost to fill the empty ones in the fleet of <persName n="553">Taurus</persName>. In anticipation of more serious misfortune he sent <persName n="313">Maecenas</persName> to Rome on account of those who were still under the spell of the memory of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, for the fame of that man had not yet lost its influence over them. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> himself visited the new colonies throughout Italy and dispelled their fear, which had been excited by the recent events. He also went to Tarentum and inspected the naval force under <persName n="553">Taurus</persName>. Then he proceeded to Vibo, where he encouraged his infantry and hastened the preparations of his fleet, the time for his second invasion of Sicily being near at hand.

100 1 <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> however did not deign to seize even the fine opportunity presented to him by so many shipwrecks. He merely offered sacrifice to the sea and to Neptune, assuming to call himself their son, and persuading himself that it was not without the special act of Providence that his enemies had been twice overwhelmed in this way in the summer months. It is said that he was so much puffed up by these circumstances that he exchanged the purple cloak customary to Roman commanders for a dark blue one, to signify that he was the adopted son of Neptune. He hoped that <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> would now take himself off, but when he learned that the latter was building ships and was about to renew the expedition against him that summer, he became alarmed at finding himself at war with a man of such indomitable spirit and such formidable preparations. He sent <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName>, with the seven ships he had brought, to reconnoitre the dockyards of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and to do whatever damage he could. <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> had been vexed for some time past because the naval command had not been given to him, and he now perceived that he was entrusted with only the ships that he had brought, because he was under suspicion. So he plotted a new desertion.

101 1 Conceiving that however matters might turn out, he should first signalize himself by some act of valour, he distributed among his companions all the gold he had, and crossed by a three days' rowing, accomplishing a distance of 1500 stades, and fell like a thunderbolt, unperceived, on the vessels that were guarding <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s shipyards, and disappeared carrying off the guard-ships by twos and threes, sinking also, or capturing, or burning the merchant vessels, laden with corn, that were moored there or sailing along the coast. Everything was thrown into confusion by this raid of <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName>, both <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> being absent, for <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> had gone away to procure timber. In a spirit of bravado <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> once ran his ship upon a sand-bank, voluntarily and contemptuously, and pretended to be stuck in the mud, until his enemies dashed down from the mountains upon him as to a certain prey, when he backed away, and left them in amazement.

When he had sufficiently shown what he was capable of, as enemy or friend, he dismissed a senator whom he had taken prisoner, named <persName n="485">Rebilus</persName>, having a view already to the future. 102 1 During his former desertion he had been a friend of <persName n="369">Mindius Marcellus</persName>, one of the companions of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and he now told his own men that <persName n="369">Mindius Marcellus</persName> had the intention of betraying his party and deserting to that of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. Then he drew near to the enemy and invited <persName n="369">Mindius Marcellus</persName> to go with him to a small island in order to have a conference. When the latter came, and there was nobody else within earshot, <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> said that he had gone back to <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> because he was ill-treated by the admiral of those days, <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName>, but that since <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> had been appointed to the command of the fleet he would come back to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, who had done him no wrong, if <persName n="369">Mindius Marcellus</persName> would bring him a safe-conduct from <persName n="341">Marcus Messala</persName>, who was commanding in <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName>'s absence. He said that on his return he would make amends for his fault by brilliant exploits, but that until the safe-conduct arrived he should be obliged to harass the forces of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> as before in order to avoid suspicion; and this he did. <persName n="341">Marcus Messala</persName> hesitated at so dirty a transaction, but he nevertheless yielded, either because he considered such things necessary in war, or be he had learned beforehand, or conjectured, the mind of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. So <persName n="357">Menodorus</persName> again deserted, and, upon the approach of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, threw himself at his feet and begged that he would pardon him without asking for the reasons for his flight. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> conceded his safety on account of the pledges made, but had him secretly watched. He dismissed the captains of his triremes and allowed them to go wherever they pleased.

103 1 When the fleet was ready <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> set sail again. He landed at Vibo and ordered <persName n="341">Marcus Messala</persName>, who had two legions of infantry, to cross over to Sicily, join the army of <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, pass through to the bay in front of Tauromenium, and station himself there, and three legions he sent to Stylis and the extremity of the straits, to await events. He ordered <persName n="553">Taurus</persName> to sail round from Tarentum to Mount Scylacium, which is opposite Tauromenium. <persName n="553">Taurus</persName> did so, having prepared himself for fighting as well as for rowing. His infantry kept even pace with him, cavalry reconnoitring by land and liburnians by sea. While he was making this movement <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, who had advanced from Vibo, made his appearance near Scylacium, and, after giving his approval to the good order of the forces, returned to Vibo. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, as I have already said, guarded all the landing places on the island and retained his fleet at Messana, in order to send aid where it might be needed.

104 1 Such were the preparations of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. Meanwhile four more legions were en route to <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> from Africa in merchant ships, being the remainder of his army. <persName n="397">Papias</persName>, one of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>' captains, threw himself in their way on the sea, and, after they had received him as a friend (for they thought that these were ships sent by <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> to meet them), destroyed them. Some ships were despatched by <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> leisurely, and when these were approaching, the merchant ships that had escaped mistook them for other enemies and fled. So some of them were burned, some captured, some upset, and the rest returned to Africa. Two legions perished in the sea, or, if any of them could swim, <persName n="568">Tisienus</persName>, the lieutenant of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, slew them when they reached the land. The other legions re-embarked and joined <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, some sooner and some later. <persName n="397">Papias</persName> sailed back to <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>.

105 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> crossed from Vibo with his whole fleet to Strongyle,19 one of the five Aeolian islands, having made a reconnaissance of the sea beforehand. Seeing large forces in front of him on the Sicilian shore at Pelorum, Mylae, and Tyndaris, he conjectured that <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> himself was there. So he left <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> in command and returned again to Vibo, and thence hastened with <persName n="341">Marcus Messala</persName> and three legions to the camp of <persName n="553">Taurus</persName>, intending to seize Tauromenium while <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> was still absent, and thus threaten him on two sides at once. In pursuance of this plan <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> moved forward from Strongyle to the island of Hiera, and as <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>' garrison made no resistance he occupied it and intended on the following day to attack, at Mylae, <persName n="150">Demochares</persName>, the lieutenant of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, who had forty ships. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> observed the menacing attitude of <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> and sent to <persName n="150">Demochares</persName> from Messana forty-five ships, under the command of his freedman <persName n="30">Apollophanes</persName>, and followed in person with seventy others.

106 1 <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName>, with half of his ships, sailed out of Hiera before daylight in order to have a naval engagement with <persName n="397">Papias</persName> only. When he saw the fleet of <persName n="30">Apollophanes</persName> also, and seventy ships on the other wing, he sent word to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> at once that <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> was at Mylae with the greater part of his naval forces. Then he placed himself with his heavy ships in the centre, and summoned the remainder of his fleet from Hiera in all haste. The preparations on both sides were superb. The ships had towers on both stem and stern. When the usual exhortation had been given and the standards raised, they rushed against each other, some coming bow on, others making flank attacks, the shouts of the men and the spray from the ships adding terror to the scene. The Pompeian ships were shorter and lighter, and better adapted to blockading and darting about. Those of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> were larger and heavier, and, consequently, slower, yet stronger to give blows and not so easily damaged. The Pompeian crews were better sailors than those of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, but the latter were stronger. Accordingly, the former excelled not so much in close fighting as in the nimbleness of their movements, and they broke oar blades and rudders, cut off oar handles, or separated the enemy's ships entirely, doing them no less harm than by ramming. Those of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> sought to cut down with their beaks the hostile ships, which were smaller in size, or shatter them, or break through them. When they came to close quarters, being higher, they could hurl missiles down upon the enemy, and more easily throw the "ravens"20 and the grappling-irons. The Pompeians whenever they were overpowered in this manner leaped into the sea.

They were picked up by their small boats, which were hovering around for this purpose, 107 1 but <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> bore down directly upon <persName n="397">Papias</persName> and struck his ship under the bow, shattering it and breaking into the hold. The men in the towers were shaken off, the water rushed into the ship, and all the oarsmen on the lower benches were cut off. The others broke through the deck and escaped by swimming. <persName n="397">Papias</persName> escaped to a ship alongside of his own, and returned to the battle. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, who observed from a mountain that his ships were making little headway, and that whenever they came to close quarters with the enemy they were denuded of fighting men, and that reinforcements were coming to <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> from Hiera, gave the signal to retire in good order. This they did, advancing and retreating little by little. <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> continued to bear down upon them, and they took refuge, not on the beach, but among the shoals formed in the sea by river deposits.

108 1 <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName>'s pilots prevented him from running his large ships on the shoals. He cast anchor in the open sea, intending to blockade the enemy and to fight a battle by night if necessary: but his friends advised him not to be carried away by rashness and not to wear out his soldiers with excessive toil and want of sleep, and not to trust to that tempestuous sea. So in the evening he reluctantly withdrew. The Pompeians made sail to their harbours, having lost thirty of their ships, and sunk five of the enemy's, and having inflicted considerable other damage and suffered as much in return. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> praised his own men because they had resisted such formidable vessels, saying they had fought against walls rather than against ships; and he rewarded them as though they had been victorious. He encouraged them to believe that, as they were lighter, they would prevail over the enemy in the straits on account of the current. He said also that he would make some addition to the height of his ships.

XII
So ended the naval battle of Mylae, between <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> and <persName n="397">Papias</persName>. 109 1 But <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> suspected that <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had gone to the camp of <persName n="553">Taurus</persName> for the purpose of attacking Tauromenium, which was the case. So, directly after supper, he sailed to Messana, leaving a part of his forces at Mylae so that <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> might think that he was still there. <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName>, as soon as he had given his army sufficient rest, set sail for Tyndaris, which was apparently ready to surrender. He entered the town, but the garrison fought valiantly and drove him out. Some other towns espoused his cause and received his garrisons, and he returned that evening to Hiera. In the meantime, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had sailed from Scylacium to Leucopetra, having learned for a certainty that <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> had gone from Messana to Mylae on account of <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName>. He was about to cross the straits from Leucopetra to Tauromenium by night, but learning of the sea‑fight he changed his mind, thinking that a victor ought not to steal his passage, but to cross with his army boldly by daylight; for he was fully convinced that <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> was still confronting <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName>. Looking down from the mountains upon the sea at daybreak and finding that it was clear of enemies, he set sail with as many troops as the ships could carry, leaving the rest with <persName n="341">Marcus Messala</persName> until the fleet could return to him. Arriving at Tauromenium, he sent messengers to demand its surrender. As his guards were not admitted, he made sail to the river Onobalas and the temple of Venus, and moored his fleet at the shrine of the Archegetes, the god of the Naxians, intending to pitch his camp there and attack Tauromenium. The Archegetes is a small statue of Apollo, erected by the Naxians when they first migrated to Sicily.

110 1 When <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> disembarked from his ship he slipped and fell, but arose without assistance. While he was yet laying out his camp, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> made his appearance with a large fleet — an astounding spectacle, since <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> believed that he had been beaten by <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName>. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>' cavalry advanced at the same time, rivalling the fleet in rapidity of movement, and his infantry was seen on the other side; so that the forces of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> were terrified at finding themselves surrounded by enemies on three sides, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> himself was alarmed because he could not send for <persName n="341">Marcus Messala</persName>. The cavalry of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> assailed <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s men while they were still fortifying their camp. If his infantry and his naval force had attacked simultaneously with the cavalry, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> might have accomplished greater results, but as it was, being inexperienced in war and ignorant of the panic among the troops of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and hesitating to begin a battle at the approach of nightfall, one part of his forces stationed themselves at the promontory of Coccynus, while his infantry, deeming it unwise to encamp near the enemy, withdrew to the town of Phoenix. Night coming on, they went to rest, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s soldiers finished their camp, but were incapacitated for battle by toil and want of sleep. They consisted of three legions, and 500 cavalry without horses, 1000 light-armed, and 2000 colonists serving as allies, but not enrolled, besides his fleet.

111 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> placed all of his infantry under charge of <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName>, and ordered him to drive back the enemy and do whatever the exigency required. He himself took ship before daylight and went seaward lest the enemy should enclose him on this side also, giving the right wing of the fleet to <persName n="569">Titinius</persName> and the left to <persName n="350">Carisius</persName>, and embarking himself on a liburnian, with which he sailed around the whole fleet, exhorting them to have courage. Having done this he lowered the general's ensign, as is customary in times of extreme danger. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> put to sea against him, and they encountered each other twice, the battle ending with the night. Some of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s ships were captured and burned; others spread their small sails and made for the Italian coast, contrary to orders. Those of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> followed them a short distance and then turned against the remainder, capturing some and burning others. Some of the crews swam ashore, most of whom were slaughtered or taken prisoners by <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>' cavalry. Some of them set out to reach the camp of <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName>, who sent only his light-armed troops to assist them as they came near, because he did not consider it prudent to move his disheartened legionaries against the enemy's infantry, who were naturally much encouraged by their victory.

112 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> spent the greater part of the night among his small boats, in doubt whether he should go back to <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> through the scattered remains of his fleet, or take refuge with <persName n="341">Marcus Messala</persName>. Providence brought him to the harbour of Abala with a single armour-bearer, without friends, attendants, or slaves. Certain persons, who had come down from the mountain to learn the news, found him shattered in body and mind and brought him in rowboats (changing from one to another for the purpose of concealment) to the camp of <persName n="341">Marcus Messala</persName>, which was not far distant. Straightway, and before he had attended to his bodily wants, he dispatched a liburnian to <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName>, and sent word throughout the mountains that he was safe, and ordered all his forces to help <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName>, and wrote to him that he would send him aid forthwith. After attending to his own person and taking a little rest, he set forth by night, accompanied by <persName n="341">Marcus Messala</persName>, to Stylis, where <persName n="101">Carinas</persName> was stationed with three legions ready to embark, and ordered him to set sail to the other side, whither he would shortly follow. He wrote to <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> and urged him to send <persName n="257">Laronius</persName> with an army to the rescue of <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> with all speed. He sent <persName n="313">Maecenas</persName> again to Rome on account of the revolutionists; and some of these, who were stirring up disorder, were punished. He also sent <persName n="341">Marcus Messala</persName> to Puteoli to bring the first legion to Vibo.

113 1 This was the same <persName n="341">Marcus Messala</persName> whom the triumvirs proscribed at Rome, and for the killing of whom money and freedom were offered as rewards. He had fled to <persName n="606">Cassius</persName> and <persName n="81">Brutus</persName>, and after their death had delivered his fleet to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, in pursuance of an agreement made between them. It seems fitting to recall this fact now in honour of Roman magnanimity, inasmuch as <persName n="341">Marcus Messala</persName>, when he had in his power, alone and overwhelmed with misfortune, the man who had proscribed him, saved him and cared for him as his commander.

<persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> was able easily to defend his camp against attack; but, being in danger from want of supplies, he drew his men out for battle and challenged the enemy. But <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> did not care to come to an engagement with men whose only hope rested in battle and whom he expected to subdue by famine. <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName>, having placed in the centre the unarmed men who had escaped to him from the ships, took to the road, grievously exposed to missiles in the open plains from the enemy's horsemen and in the broken country from the light-armed troops from Numidia in Africa, who hurled javelins from long distances and made their escape when charged by their enemies.

114 1 On the fourth day, with difficulty, they arrived at the waterless region which they say was formerly inundated by a stream of fire that ran down as far as the sea and dried up all the springs in the district. The inhabitants of the country traverse it only by night, on account of the stifling heat and the dust and ashes with which it abounds. Being ignorant of the roads and fearing ambush, <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> and his men did not dare to march through it by night, especially as there was no moon, nor could they endure it by day, but even suffocated, and the soles of their feet were burned (especially those who had no shoes), as it was now the hottest part of the summer; and since delay was impossible on account of the tormenting thirst, they no longer resisted their assailants, but received wounds without any means of defence. When they saw the place of exit from this burned district occupied by enemies, the able-bodied ones, dashed at the defile with amazing courage and overpowered the enemy with all their remaining strength. When they found the next defile occupied by hostile forces they gave way to despair and succumbed to thirst and heat. <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName> aroused them by showing them a spring of water near by; and again they overpowered the enemy, but with heavy loss to themselves. Another body of enemies held possession of the fountain, and now <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName>' men lost all courage and gave way completely.

115 1 While they were in this state <persName n="257">Laronius</persName>, who had been sent by <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> with three legions, made his appearance a long way off. Although it was not yet plain that he was a friend, still, as hope all the time led them to expect a friend, they once more recovered their spirits. When they saw the enemy abandon the water in order not to be exposed to attack on both sides, they shouted for joy with all their strength; and when the troops of <persName n="257">Laronius</persName> shouted in return, they ran and seized the fountain. The leaders forbade the men to drink to excess: those who neglected this advice died while drinking.

In this unexpected manner did <persName n="125">Cornificius</persName>, and those of his army who managed to get away, escape to <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> at Mylae.21 116 1 <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName>, however, had just taken Tyndaris, a stronghold full of provisions and admirably situated for naval warfare. Thither <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> transported his infantry and cavalry. He had in Sicily altogether twenty-one legions of infantry, 20,000 cavalry, and more than 5000 light-armed troops. The garrison of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> still held Mylae, and all places from Mylae to Naulochi and Pelorus, and all the coast. These garrisons, in fear of <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName>, kept fires burning continually, signifying that they would set fire to any ships that should sail against them. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> was also master of the defiles on both sides of the island. The mountain passes in the neighbourhood of Tauromenium and around Mylae were fortified by him, and he harassed <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> when the latter was making a forward movement from Tyndaris, but not coming to an engagement. Believing that <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> was moving his fleet against him, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> changed his position to Pelorus, abandoning the defiles around Mylae; and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> occupied them and also Mylae and Artemisium, a very small town, in which, they say, were the cattle of the Sun and where Ulysses fell asleep.

117 1 When the report of <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName>'s movement turned out to be false, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> was troubled that he had lost the defiles,22 and he called to his assistance <persName n="568">Tisienus</persName>, with his army. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> thought to intercept <persName n="568">Tisienus</persName>, but lost his way around Mount Myconium. He passed the night there without tents. There was a heavy rainfall, as often occurs in the autumn, and some of his armour-bearers held a Gallic shield over his head the whole night. Harsh mutterings and prolonged roars from Mount Etna were heard, accompanied by flames which lighted up the camp, so that the Germans sprang from their beds in fear. Others, who had heard what had been related of Mount Etna, would not have been surprised, in presence of these remarkable phenomena, if even the torrent of fire had rolled upon them. After this <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> ravaged the territory of the Palaestenians, where <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, who was foraging, met him, and they both encamped near Messana.

118 1 As there had been many skirmishes throughout Sicily, but no general engagement, <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> sent <persName n="553">Taurus</persName> to cut off <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>' supplies by first capturing the towns that furnished them. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> was so much inconvenienced by this that he decided to stake everything on a great battle. Since he feared the enemy's infantry, but had confidence in his own ships, he sent and asked <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> if he would allow the war to be decided by a naval engagement. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, although he dreaded all naval encounters, which until now had turned out badly for him, considered it base to refuse, and, accordingly, accepted the challenge. A day was fixed by them, for which 300 ships were put in readiness on either side, provided with missiles of all kinds, with towers and whatever machines they could think of. <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> devised one called the "grip," a piece of wood five cubits long bound with iron and having rings at the extremities. To one of these rings was attached the grip itself, an iron claw, to the other numerous ropes, which drew it by machine power after it had been thrown by a catapult and had seized the enemy's ships.

119 1 When the appointed day came the rival shouts of the oarsmen were first heard, accompanied by missiles thrown by machines and by hand, such as stones, firebrands, and arrows. Then the ships dashed against each other, some striking amidships, others on the prows, others on the beaks, where the blows are most effectual in discomposing the combatants and rendering the vessel useless. Others broke the opposing line by sailing through it, at the same time discharging arrows and javelins; and the small boats picked up those who fell overboard. There was a struggle of soldiers while the sailors put forth their strength and the pilots their skill and their lung-power; the generals cheered their men, and all the machines were brought into requisition. The "grip" achieved the greatest success. Thrown from a long distance upon the ships, as it could be by reason of its lightness, it clutched them, as soon as the ropes pulled on it from behind. On account of the iron bands it could not be easily cut by the men whom it attacked, and those who tried to cut the ropes were prevented from reaching them by its length. As this apparatus had never been known before, the enemy had not provided themselves with scythe-mounted poles. One thing seemed advisable in this unexpected emergency, and that was, to back water and draw the ship away; but as the enemy did the same the force exerted by the men was equal on both sides, and the grip did its work.

120 1 Accordingly, when the ships were drawn together, there was every kind of fighting, the men leaping upon each other's decks. It was no longer easy to distinguish an enemy from a friend, as they used the same weapons for the most part, and nearly all spoke the Latin tongue, and the watchwords of each side were divulged to the other while they were mingled together. Hence arose many and divers frauds and lack of confidence on both sides on the part of those using the same watchword. They failed to recognize each other, what with the fighting and the sea, now a confused medley of corpses, clashing arms, and crashing ships; for they left nothing untried except fire. This they abstained from, after their first onset, because they were locked together. The foot-soldiers of each army on the land beheld this sea-fight with apprehension and eagerness, believing that their own hope of safety was bound up in it. They could not distinguish anything, however sharply they might look, but merely a long-drawn‑out line of 600 ships, and an alternation of cries and groans now on one side and now on the other.

121 1 Judging from the colours of the towers, which constituted the only difference between them, <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> with difficulty made out that <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>' ships had sustained the greater loss, and he cheered on those who were close to him as though they were already victors. Then he drove at the enemy and pressed upon them without ceasing, until he overpowered those nearest him. They then lowered their towers and turned their ships in flight toward the straits. Seventeen of them, which were in advance, made their escape thither. The rest were cut off by <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> and some were pursued and driven aground. The pursuers ran aground with them in the rush, and either pulled off those that had come to a standstill or set fire to them. When the Pompeian ships that were still fighting saw what had befallen these, they surrendered to their enemies. Then the soldiers of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> who were in the ships raised a shout of victory and those on land gave an answering shout. Those of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> groaned. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> himself, darting away from Naulochi, hastened to Messana, giving not even orders to his infantry in his panic. Accordingly <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> received the surrender of these also at the hands of <persName n="568">Tisienus</persName> on terms agreed upon, and of the cavalry besides, who were surrendered by their officers. Three of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s ships were sunk in the fight. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> lost twenty-eight in this way, and the remainder were burned, or captured, or run aground and stove in pieces, except the seventeen that escaped.

122 1 <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> learned of the defection of his infantry while on the road, and changed his costume from that of a commander to that of a private citizen, and sent orders to Messana to put on shipboard everything possible. All preparations to this end had been made long before. He summoned <persName n="417">Plenius</persName> from Lilybaeum in haste, with the eight legions he had, intending to take flight with them. <persName n="417">Plenius</persName> hastened to comply with this order, but as other friends, garrisons, and soldiers were deserting, and the enemy's fleet was moving into the straits, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> did not wait even for <persName n="417">Plenius</persName> in his well-fortified city, but fled, with his seventeen ships, from Messana to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, remembering that he had saved his mother in similar circumstances. After his departure <persName n="417">Plenius</persName> arrived at Messana and occupied the place. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> himself remained in the camp at Naulochi, but he ordered <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> to lay siege to Messana, which the latter did, in conjunction with <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>. <persName n="417">Plenius</persName> sent envoys to treat for peace. <persName n="9">Agrippa</persName> wanted to wait till morning for the arrival of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, but <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> granted terms, and in order to conciliate the soldiers of <persName n="417">Plenius</persName> to himself allowed them to join the rest of the army in plundering the city.

XIII
These had asked for nothing but safety, and now, finding unexpected gain in addition, they plundered Messana the whole night, in conjunction with the soldiers of <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, and then ranged themselves under his standards. 123 1 Including this new accession, <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> now had twenty-two legions of infantry and a large body of cavalry; so that he was elated, and thought to make himself master of Sicily, using the pretext that he was the first to invade the island and that he had induced many cities to join the triumvirs. He sent word at once to the garrisons of these places that they should not admit the emissaries of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and he seized all the defiles. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> arrived on the following day, and reproached <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> through friends, who reminded him that he had come into Sicily as an ally of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, not to acquire it for himself. <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> replied that he had been despoiled of his former allotment, which was now in the exclusive possession of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and that, if the latter pleased, he would now exchange Africa and Sicily for that former allotment. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, exasperated, came also in person to <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> in anger and heaped reproaches on him for ingratitude. They separated, indulging in mutual threats. They forthwith surrounded themselves with guards, and the ships of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> were anchored away from the shore, as it was said that <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> intended to set fire to them.

124 1 The soldiers were angry at the thought that they were to engage in another civil war, and that there was never to be an end of sedition. They did not, however, seek to compare <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> and <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>; not even the army of <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> did that. They admired the energy of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and they were aware of the indolence of <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>; they also blamed him for admitting the defeated enemy to an equal share of the plunder. When <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> learned their state of mind, he sent emissaries among them to advise them secretly of their individual interests. Many of them he tampered with, especially those who had served under <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, who feared lest the terms of their capitulation should not be valid if <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> did not ratify them. While <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, by reason of his ineptitude, remained ignorant of these things <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> came to his camp with a large body of horse, whom he left at the entrance, and himself went in with a few. Coming forward, he declared to those whom he met that he was drawn into war unwillingly. Those who saw him saluted him as imperator. First of all the Pompeians, who had been tampered with, collected together and asked his forgiveness. He said that he was astonished that persons asking forgiveness should not do what their own interests demanded. They understood his meaning, and forthwith seized their standards and went over to him, while others began to take down their tents.

125 1 When <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> became aware of this tumult he sprang from his tent to arms. Blows were already exchanged and one of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s armour-bearers was killed. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> himself was struck by a weapon on his breastplate, but it did not penetrate the flesh, and he ran and took refuge with his horsemen. A detachment of guards belonging to <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> jeered at him as he ran. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was so angry that he could not restrain himself from cutting them off with horsemen and destroying them. The officers of the other guards transferred their allegiance from <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, some immediately, others during the night; some without solicitation, others pretending to be coerced more or less by the cavalry. There were some who still resisted the assault and beat off the assailants, for <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> sent reinforcements in all directions; but when these also went over, the remainder of his army, even those who were yet well disposed toward him, changed their opinion. Again the first to move were those Pompeians who still remained with him, transferring themselves by detachments, one after another. <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> armed the other body to prevent them from going, but the very men who were armed for this purpose seized their standards and went over to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> with the rest. <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> threatened and besought them as they took their departure. He held fast to the standards, and said he would not give them up, until one of the standard-bearers said to him, "Let go, or you are a dead man." Then he was afraid and let go.

126 1 The last to come over were the cavalry. They sent a messenger to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> to ask if they should kill <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, who was no longer a commander. He replied in the negative. Thus <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> found himself deserted by all and bereft, in a moment of time, of so exalted a station and so great an army. He changed his costume and hastened to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, all the spectators running with him to enjoy the spectacle. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> started up as he approached, and prevented him from throwing himself at his feet, and sent him to Rome in the garb of a private citizen, which he was wearing, deprived of his command, but not of the priesthood, which he held.

And so this man, who had often been a commander and once a triumvir, who had appointed magistrates and had proscribed many men of his own rank, passed his life as a private citizen, asking favours of some of the proscribed, who were magistrates at a later period. 127 1 <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> neither pursued <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> nor allowed others to do so; either because he refrained from encroaching on <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s dominions, or because he preferred to wait and see what <persName n="27">Antony</persName> would do to <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> and make that a pretext for a quarrel if he should do wrong (for they had long entertained the suspicion that ambition would bring them into mutual conflict when other rivals were out of the way), or, as <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> said later, because <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> was not one of his father's murderers. He now brought his forces together, and they amounted to forty-five legions of infantry, 25,000 horse and some 40,000 light-armed troops, with 600 war-ships; he had also an immense number of merchant-vessels, which nevertheless he sent back to their owners. To the soldiers he awarded the prizes of victory, paying a part down and promising the rest later. He distributed crowns and other honours to all, and granted pardon to the Pompeian leaders.

128 1 With all this success he was prosperous beyond words, and of his great prosperity Fortune became jealous. His army revolted, especially his own troops. They demanded to be discharged from the service and that rewards should be given them equal to those given to the men who had fought at Philippi. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> knew that the present war had not been of the same grade as that one. He promised nevertheless to pay what their services were worth, and to include the soldiers serving under <persName n="27">Antony</persName> when he too should return. As to their breach of discipline, he reminded them, in a threatening tone, of the laws of their ancestors, of their oaths and of the punishments. As they gave little heed to what he said, he abandoned his threatening tone lest the spirit of mutiny should extend to his newly acquired troops, and said that he would discharge them at the proper time in conjunction with <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. He said, also, that he would not engage them in any more civil wars, which had fortunately come to an end, but in war against the Illyrians and other barbarous tribes, who were disturbing the peace which had been gained with so much difficulty; from which war the soldiers would acquire great riches. They said that they would not go to war again until they had received the prizes and honours of the previous wars. He said that he would not even now postpone the honours, but that he had distributed many prizes, and now gave to the legions additional crowns, and to the centurions and tribunes purple-bordered garments and the dignity of chief councillors in their native towns. While he was distributing other awards of this kind, the tribune <persName n="393">Ofillius</persName> exclaimed that crowns and purple garments were playthings for boys, that the rewards for soldiers were lands and money. The multitude cried out "Well said"; whereupon <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> descended from the platform in anger. The soldiers gathered round the tribune, praising him and railing at those who did not join with them, and the tribune said that he alone would suffice to defend so just a cause. After saying this he disappeared the following day, and it was never known what became of him.

129 1 The soldiers no longer dared to give utterance to their complaints singly, but joined together in groups and called for their discharge in common. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> conciliated their leaders in various ways. He released those who had served at Philippi and Mutina, and who wished to be discharged, as their time had expired. These, to the number of 20,000, he dismissed and sent out of the island at once, lest they should seduce the others. To those only who had served at Mutina he added, that, although they were discharged in this way, he would fulfil the promises made to them at that time. He came before the rest of the army and called upon them to bear witness to the perjury of the revolters, who had been dismissed not by the wish of their military commander. He praised those who remained with him, and encouraged them to expect a speedy release, saying that nobody would regret it, that they would be discharged rich, and that he would give them 500 drachmas per man now. Having thus spoken, he exacted tribute from Sicily to the amount of 1600 talents, appointed propraetors for Africa and Sicily, and assigned a division of the army to each of these provinces. He sent back <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s ships to Tarentum. A part of the army he sent in advance of himself to Italy in ships, and took the remainder with him when he departed from the island.

130 1 When he arrived at Rome the Senate voted him unbounded honours, giving him the privilege of accepting all, or such as he chose. They and the people went out a long distance to meet him, wearing garlands on their heads, and escorted him, when he arrived, first to the temples, and then from the temples to his house. The next day he made speeches to the Senate and to the people, recounting his exploits and his policy from the beginning to the present time. These speeches he wrote down and published in pamphlet form. He proclaimed peace and good-will, said that the interviews were ended, remitted the unpaid taxes, and released the farmers of the revenue and the holders of public leases from what they owed. Of the honours voted to him, he accepted an ovation and annual solemnities on the days of his victories, and a golden image to be erected in the forum, with the garb he wore when he entered the city, to stand on a column covered with the beaks of captured ships. There the image was placed bearing the inscription:—

PEACE, LONG DISTURBED, HE RE-ESTABLISHED ON LAND AND SEA."

131 1 When the people desired to transfer from <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> to himself the office of pontifex maximus, which the law bestowed on one person for life, he would not accept it, and when they prayed that <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName> might be put to death as a public enemy he would not allow it. He sent sealed letters to all the armies, with instructions to open them all on a day designated and to execute the orders contained therein. These orders related to slaves who had run away during the civil dissensions and joined the armies, for whom <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> had asked freedom, which the Senate and treaty had granted. These were all arrested on the same day and brought to Rome, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> returned them to their Roman and Italian masters, or to the heirs of the same. He also gave back those belonging to Sicilian masters. Those whom nobody claimed he caused to be put to death in the cities from which they had absconded.

132 1 This seemed to be the end of the civil dissensions. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> was now twenty-eight years of age. Cities joined in placing him among their tutelary gods. At this time Italy and Rome itself were openly infested with bands of robbers, whose doings were more like barefaced plunder than secret theft. <persName n="182">Gaius Calvisius</persName> was chosen by <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> to correct this disorder. He executed many of the captured brigands, and within one year brought about a condition of absolute security. At that time, they say, originated the custom and system of cohorts of night watchmen still in force. <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> excited astonishment by putting an end to this evil with such unexampled rapidity. He allowed the yearly magistrates to administer public affairs, in many particulars, according to the customs of the country. He burned the writings which contained evidence concerning the civil strife, and said that he would restore the constitution entirely when <persName n="27">Antony</persName> should return from the Parthian war, for he was persuaded that <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, too, would be willing to lay down the government, the civil wars being at an end. Thereupon he was chosen tribune for life by acclamation, the people urging him, by the offer of this perpetual magistracy, to give up his former one. This he accepted, and at the same time he wrote privately to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> in reference to the government. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> gave instructions to <persName n="280">Lucius Bibulus</persName>, who was going away from him, to confer with <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>. He sent governors to take charge of his provinces in like manner as <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had done, and he had thoughts of joining the latter in his expedition against the Illyrians.

XIV
133 1 <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, fleeing from Sicily to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, stopped at the Lacinian promontory and robbed the rich temple of Juno of its gifts. He landed at Mitylene and spent some time at that place, where his father, when at war with <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>, had bestowed him with his mother, while still a boy, and after his defeat had joined him again. As <persName n="27">Antony</persName> was now waging war in Media against the Medes and the Parthians, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> decided to entrust himself to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> on his return. When he heard that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had been beaten, and this result was more than confirmed by reports, his hopes were once more revived, and he fancied that he might succeed <persName n="27">Antony</persName> if the latter were dead, or share his power if he returned. He was continually thinking of <persName n="253">Labienus</persName>, who had overrun Asia not long before. While he was in this frame of mind the news reached him that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had returned to Alexandria. Scheming for both objects, he sent ambassadors to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> ostensibly to place himself at the latter's disposal and to offer himself as a friend and ally, but really to get accurate information about <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s affairs. At the same time he sent others secretly to the princes of Thrace and Pontus, intending, if he should not obtain what he desired from <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, to take flight through Pontus to Armenia. He sent also to the Parthians, hoping that, for the remainder of their war against <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, they would be eager to receive him as a general, because he was a Roman, and especially because he was the son of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. He refitted his ships and drilled the soldiers he had brought in them, pretending at one time that he was in fear of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>, and at another that he was getting ready to assist <persName n="27">Antony</persName>.

134 1 As soon as <persName n="27">Antony</persName> heard of the coming of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> he designated <persName n="603">Titius</persName> to take the field against him. He ordered the latter to take ships and soldiers from Syria and to wage war vigorously against <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> if he showed himself hostile, but to treat him with honour if he submitted himself to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. Then he gave audience to the messengers who had arrived, and address him as follows: "<persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> has sent us to you, not because he cannot take refuge (if he were minded to continue war) in Spain, a country friendly to him on his father's account, which espoused his own cause when he was younger, and even now calls upon him for that purpose, but because he prefers to enjoy peace with you, and, if need be, to fight under your orders. He makes these advances now not for the first time, but did so while he was master of Sicily and was ravaging Italy, and when he rescued your mother and sent her to you. If you had accepted these advances, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> would not have been driven out of Sicily (for you would not have provided <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> with ships against him), nor would you have been defeated in Parthia, in consequence of <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> not sending you the soldiers he agreed to send. In fact, you would now be in possession of Italy in addition to your other dominions. As you did not accept the offer at the time when it would have been most advantageous to you, he repeats it now in order that you may not be so often ensnared by <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>'s words and by the marriage relationship existing between you; for you will remember that, although he is connected by marriage with <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, he declared war against him after the treaty had been made, and without excuse. He also deprived <persName n="264">Lepidus</persName>, his partner in the government, of his share, and divided neither part of it with you.

135 1 "You are now the only remaining one who stands between him and the monarchy that he longs for: indeed he would already have been at blows with you, had not <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> stood in the way. Although you ought to have foreseen these things for yourself, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> calls your attention to them out of good-will, because he prefers a candid and magnanimous man to a deceitful, treacherous, and artful one. He does not blame you for the gift of ships which you made to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> against him as a matter of necessity, in order to procure soldiers for the Parthian war in exchange, but he reminds you of that army which was not sent. In short, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> delivers himself to you with the ships which he still has and his most faithful soldiers, who have not abandoned him even in his flight. If peace is maintained, it will be a great glory to you to have saved the son of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. In case of war, he will be a considerable help to your party in the conflict which is coming, in fact is as good as come."

136 1 When the messengers had thus spoken, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> showed them the orders he had sent to <persName n="603">Titius</persName>, and said that if <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> was truly in this frame of mind he would be coming in person under the escort of <persName n="603">Titius</persName>. In the meantime, the messengers who had been sent by <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> to the Parthians were captured by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s generals and brought to Alexandria. After <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had examined each of them he summoned the ambassadors of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> and showed the captives to them. They made excuses for <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> even then as a young man in a desperate plight, fearful lest <persName n="27">Antony</persName> should not treat him kindly, and driven by necessity to make trial even of the bitterest enemies of Rome. They said that he would show his true disposition as soon as he should learn <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s, and would then need no other attempt or devices. <persName n="27">Antony</persName> believed them, being in other respects and at all times of a frank, magnanimous, and unsuspecting nature.

137 1 In the meantime <persName n="175">Furnius</persName>, who was governing the province of Asia for <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, had received <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> when he arrived, as he was behaving quietly; since <persName n="175">Furnius</persName> had not sufficient force to prevent him and did not yet know <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s mind. Seeing <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> drilling his troops, he mustered a force from the provincials and hastily summoned <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>, who had command of an army in the vicinity, and also <persName n="18">Amyntas</persName> from the other side. They responded promptly, and <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> complained against <persName n="175">Furnius</persName> for regarding him in the light of an enemy when he had sent ambassadors to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and was waiting for an answer from him. While he was saying this he was meditating the project of seizing <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>, with the connivance of <persName n="139">Curius</persName>, one of <persName n="153">Domitius Ahenobarbus</persName>' officers, intending to hold that general as a valuable hostage to exchange for himself in case of need. The treachery was discovered and <persName n="139">Curius</persName> was convicted before the Romans present and put to death. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> put to death his freedman <persName n="557">Theodorus</persName>, the only person who was privy to the plan, believing that he had divulged it. As he no longer expected to conceal his projects from <persName n="175">Furnius</persName>, he possessed himself of Lampsacus by treachery, a city which contained many Italians, placed there as colonists by <persName n="89">Caesar</persName>. These Italians he induced to enter his military service by large bounties. Having now 200 horse and three legions of infantry, he attacked Cyzicus by land and sea. He was repulsed on both sides, because <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had a force, although not a large one, in Cyzicus, that was guarding some gladiators whom <persName n="27">Antony</persName> supported there. So <persName n="423">Pompey</persName> retired to the harbour of the Achaeans and collected provisions.

138 1 <persName n="175">Furnius</persName> did not begin hostilities, but he continually camped alongside of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> with a large body of horse and prevented his foe from foraging or winning the cities to his side. As <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> had no cavalry, he assaulted the camp of <persName n="175">Furnius</persName> in front and, at the same time, sent a force secretly around to his rear. <persName n="175">Furnius</persName> accordingly directed his forces against <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>' front attack, but he was driven out of his camp by the force in his rear. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> pursued his men and killed many as they fled over the Scamandrian plain, which was saturated with recent rains. Those who were saved withdrew for the time to a place of safety, as they were not fit for battle. While those who, impoverished by continual exactions, enlisted gladly under <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> especially on account of the reputation he had gained by his victory at the harbour of the Achaeans, were awaiting help from Mysia, the Propontis, and elsewhere, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, deficient in cavalry, and thus crippled in procuring supplies, learned that a troop of Italian horse was coming to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, sent by <persName n="388">Octavia</persName>, who was passing the winter in Athens. So he sent emissaries with gold to corrupt this troop.

<persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s governor of Macedonia caught these men and distributed their gold to the cavalry: 139 1 but <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> took Nicea and Nicomedia, from which he obtained large supplies of money, and his strength was augmented in all respects with a rapidity that exceeded his expectations. But <persName n="175">Furnius</persName>, who was camping not far away from him, was reinforced, at the beginning of spring, first with seventy ships that had come from Sicily, which had been saved from those that <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had lent to <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> against <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>; for after the close of the war in Sicily <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> had dismissed them. Then <persName n="603">Titius</persName> arrived from Syria with 120 additional ships and a large army; and all these had landed at Proconnesus. So <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> became alarmed and burned his own ships and armed his oarsmen, believing that he could fight to better advantage with all of his forces combined on land. <persName n="399">Parmesius</persName>, <persName n="381">Nasidius</persName>, <persName n="504">Saturninus</persName>, <persName n="559">Thermus</persName>, <persName n="24">Antistius</persName>, and the other distinguished men of his party who were still with him as friends, and <persName n="161">Fannius</persName>, who held the highest rank of all, and <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>' father-in‑law, <persName n="297">Lucius Libo</persName>, when they saw that he did not desist from war against superior forces even after <persName n="603">Titius</persName>, to whom <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had given entire charge, had arrived, despaired of him, and, having made terms for themselves, went over to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>.

140 1 <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, now deserted by his friends, withdrew to the interior of Bithynia, being reported as making his way to Armenia. One night as he marched out of his camp quietly, <persName n="175">Furnius</persName> and <persName n="603">Titius</persName> followed him, and <persName n="18">Amyntas</persName> joined in the pursuit. After a hot chase they came up with him toward evening, and each encamped by himself around a certain hill without ditch or palisade, as it was late and they were tired. While they were in this state, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> made a night attack with 300 light troops and killed many who were still asleep or springing out of bed. The rest took to disgraceful flight completely naked. It is evident that if <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> had made this night attack with his entire army, or if he had followed up energetically the victory he did win, he would have overcome them completely. But, misled by some evil genius, he let slip these opportunities also, and he gained no other advantage from the affair than to penetrate farther into the interior of the country. His enemies, having formed a junction, followed him and cut him off from supplies, until he was in danger from want. Then he sought an interview with <persName n="175">Furnius</persName>, who had been a friend of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, and who was of higher rank and of a more trustworthy character than the others.

141 1 Taking a position where a river flowed between them, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> said that he had sent ambassadors to <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, and he added that, being in need of provisions meanwhile, and they supplying him, he had done what he had done. "If you fight against me," he continued, "by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s direction, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> has misconceived his own interests in not foreseeing the coming war. If you are anticipating <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s intentions, I protest and implore you to wait for the embassy that I sent to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> or to take and bring me to him now. I will surrender myself to you alone, <persName n="175">Furnius</persName>, asking merely your pledge that you will conduct me to him in safety." He spoke thus because had confidence in <persName n="27">Antony</persName> as a man of generous nature, and he apprehended merely that something might happen to him on the journey. <persName n="175">Furnius</persName> replied to him as follows: "If you wish to surrender yourself to <persName n="27">Antony</persName> you ought to have done so in the beginning, or else have waited quietly at Mitylene for his answer. But if you desired the war you should have done as you have done; for why is it necessary to recount your deeds to one who knows them? If now you repent, do not bring us, generals, into collision with each other, but surrender yourself to <persName n="603">Titius</persName>, to whom these matters have been entrusted by <persName n="27">Antony</persName>. The pledge which you ask from me you can ask from him. He has been ordered by <persName n="27">Antony</persName> to put you to death if you wage war, but, if you surrender yourself, to send you to him in an honourable manner."

142 1 <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> was angry with <persName n="603">Titius</persName> for his ingratitude, in that he undertook to wage this war against him, for he had once been taken prisoner and spared by <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>. Besides being angry he considered it beneath his dignity that a <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> should be in the power of <persName n="603">Titius</persName>, who was not of noble birth. Moreover he suspected <persName n="603">Titius</persName>, either because he was acquainted with his character and did not consider him trustworthy, or because he was conscious of some old injury done to him previous to the benefaction above mentioned. Again he offered to surrender himself to <persName n="175">Furnius</persName>, and begged that he would receive him. When the latter refused he said that he would surrender to <persName n="18">Amyntas</persName>. <persName n="175">Furnius</persName> said that <persName n="18">Amyntas</persName> would not receive him, because that would be an insult to the one whom <persName n="27">Antony</persName> had entrusted with this whole business; and so the interview ended. The opinion prevailed in the camp of <persName n="175">Furnius</persName> that, for want of other resources, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> would deliver himself up to <persName n="603">Titius</persName> on the following day. When night came <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> left the customary fires burning, and the trumpets giving the usual signal at intervals through the night, while he quietly withdrew from the camp with a well-prepared band, who had not previously been advised whither they were to go. He intended to go to the sea-shore and burn <persName n="603">Titius</persName>' fleet, and perhaps would have done so had not <persName n="508">Scaurus</persName> deserted from him and communicated the fact of his departure and the road he had taken, although ignorant of his design. <persName n="18">Amyntas</persName>, with 1500 horse, pursued <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, who had no cavalry. When <persName n="18">Amyntas</persName> drew near, <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>' men passed over to him, some privately, others openly. <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, being almost entirely deserted and afraid of his own men, surrendered himself to <persName n="18">Amyntas</persName> without conditions, although he had scorned to surrender to <persName n="603">Titius</persName> with conditions.

143 1 Thus was <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> captured. He was the last remaining son of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>, and had been deprived of his father when very young and of his brother while still a stripling. After their death he concealed himself for a long time and practised robbery secretly in Spain until he had collected a large following, because he made himself known as <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>'s son. Then he practised more open robbery. After the death of <persName n="89">Caesar</persName> he carried on war vigorously and collected a large army, together with ships and money, took islands, became master of the western sea, brought famine upon Italy, and compelled his enemies to make peace on such terms as he chose. Of most importance was the aid that he rendered in the proscriptions to Rome when exposed to utter destruction, rescuing many of the nobility who were, at this later time, safe at home by means of him. But stricken with some strange aberration, he never pursued an aggressive policy against his foes, although fortune offered him many opportunities; he only defended himself.

144 1 After such a career <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> was taken prisoner. <persName n="603">Titius</persName> brought <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>' soldiers into <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s service and put <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName> himself to death at Miletus in the fortieth year of his age. This he did either on his own account, angry at some former insult, and ungrateful for the subsequent kindness, or in pursuance of <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s order. Some say that <persName n="378">Plancus</persName>, not <persName n="27">Antony</persName>, gave this order. They think that <persName n="378">Plancus</persName>, while governing Syria, was authorized by letters to sign <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s name in cases of urgency and to use his seal. Some think that it was written by <persName n="378">Plancus</persName> with <persName n="27">Antony</persName>'s knowledge, but that the latter was ashamed to write it on account of the name <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, and because <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName> was favourable to him on account of <persName n="423">Pompey</persName>. Others think that <persName n="378">Plancus</persName>, being cognizant of these facts, took it upon himself to give the order as a matter of precaution, lest <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, with the co-operation of <persName n="114">Cleopatra</persName>, should disturb the auspicious respect between <persName n="27">Antony</persName> and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName>.

145 1 After the death of <persName n="538">Sextus Pompey</persName>, <persName n="27">Antony</persName> made a new expedition to Armenia, and <persName n="61">Augustus</persName> made one against the Illyrians, who were plundering Italy, some of whom had never been subject to the Romans, while others had revolted during the civil wars. Since these Illyrian affairs are not very well known to me, and are not of sufficient length to make a book by themselves, and have no suitable place to be treated elsewhere, I have recorded them above (beginning with the time when Illyria was acquired by the Romans and bringing them down to the end), and added them to the history of Macedonia, which marches with Illyria.
